The only exception to this rule is the Mayor, le Comte de Reynaud, who is seen as the town's moral authority, even more so than Pere Henri, the new young Catholic priest whose sermons are vetted by le Comte. Literally blowing into town is free spirit Vianne Rocher and her adolescent daughter Anouk Rocher, who move from place to place wherever the north wind takes them. Renting the long empty space that used to house the patisserie, the property owned by elderly Armande Voizin, Vianne instead opens a chocolaterie which none of the residents are aware of until it opens. While Vianne, through the chocolaterie, is able to help certain residents in exposing some of the village's hidden ills, she nonetheless raises the ire of le Comte in almost everything about her being: that she is promoting the indulgence of chocolate in the season of Lent, a period of abstinence and penitence; that she does not attend church; and that she has never been married meaning that Anouk is illegitimate. Vianne is viewed in an even less flattering light when she takes up with Roux, the lead of a band of self-confessed river rats floating into town, he, who like Vianne, is a nomadic free spirit. The questions become who between Vianne and le Comte will outlast the other or come to an understanding of the errors of their ways to be able to live in harmony with the other.","['Alfred Molina', 'Carrie-Anne Moss', 'Aurelien Parent Koenig', 'Antonio Gil', 'Hélène Cardona']","['Betty Ainslie', 'Tarik Ait Ben Ali', 'Walter Bienz', 'Françoise Bouillon-Pommerolle', 'Tabitha Burrill']",['Lasse Hallström'],"['United Kingdom', 'United States']","['English', 'French']","['Miramax', 'David Brown Productions', 'Fat Free']"

They discover that their kitchen is full of prepackaged pudding, how they got all the pudding they are unaware. From a telephone message they receive, they come to the realization that at some point during the previous night they were at a party at the house of their girlfriends, twins Wanda and Wilma, and that today is their one year anniversary, which they did remember as they already bought the twins gifts.

That marital status changes when on Christmas Day 1995 as Chuck is rushing off to catch yet another FedEx plane for a business trip, he gives Kelly a ring. That flight experiences technical difficulties, and goes down somewhere in the south Pacific. In a life raft, a relatively unharmed Chuck washes up on shore what he will learn is a deserted island, he unaware what has happened to any of his fellow flight mates, or the plane. However several of the packages on board for delivery do wash up on shore with him, those packages which he initially treats with respect. Chuck realizes that his priority is survival - which primarily means food, water, shelter and fire - and rescue. But survival is also in an emotional sense. To fulfill that emotional need, he has an heirloom pocket watch with Kelly's photo that she gave him as a Christmas present, and eventually opening the FedEx packages, a Wilson volleyball on which he paints a face and which he names Wilson. As time progresses, Chuck goes through a range of emotions, but if rescue is ever in the cards, he realizes that he has to find a way to get off the island, which is seemingly impossible in his circumstance due to the strong on shore surf he cannot get beyond without assistance. What Chuck may not fully realize is the longer he is not rescued, the harder it will be for him to return to his old life in its entirety if he ever is rescued. Although the thought of Kelly is what largely keeps him motivated to be rescued, Kelly, who probably believes him to be dead, may have moved on emotionally from him in the intervening time.","['Paul Sanchez', 'Lari White', 'Leonid Citer', 'David Allen Brooks', 'Yelena Popovic']","['Geoff Abadee', 'Wendy Altman-Cohen', 'Neil Andrea', 'Charlie Araki', 'Brett Avery']",['Robert Zemeckis'],['United States'],"['English', 'Russian']","['Twentieth Century Fox', 'Dreamworks Pictures', 'ImageMovers', 'Playtone']"

As such, one of her by-the-books colleagues, Eric Matthews, who has never shown any inclination of thinking outside the box, is assigned to lead the high profile case of a terrorist coined The Citizen instead of her, while she is facing possible disciplinary action. Gracie pieces together the evidence to determine that The Citizen's next target will be the Miss United States beauty pageant. The pageant represents everything that Gracie abhors. Despite Gracie's mannish demeanor, Eric, with no other undercover female Agent remotely fitting the demographic, assigns her to go undercover as a pageant contestant to see if she can flush out The Citizen, who is perhaps one of the other contestants. Although the pageant administration, led by former winner Cathy Morningside and long time host Stan Fields, provide the F.B.I. with access to the pageant, Cathy in particular is less than thrilled to have a non-credible Gracie posing as a contestant, which she feels will ruin the pageant.

Conversely, Rita, who grew up in an upper middle class home in suburban Lake Forest, can't help but be scared of life in seeing the world's problems all around her, her socialist viewpoints which she has never been able to convey to her conservative parents, Dr. Marshall and Marian Boyle. After a short but intense courtship, they decide to get married in a tasteful backyard ceremony at her parents' house. It is during their honeymoon in Jamaica that Peter comes to a realization that who is with him on this honeymoon may be Rita in body, but not in soul or spirit. Upon meeting him again back in Chicago, Peter believes that the soul inhabiting Rita's body belongs to the old man who crashed their wedding, he who requested a kiss from Rita, which she obliged. The old man, into whose body Rita's soul has moved, confirms as much. Peter has to decide who he will confide in in this rather fantastical story in his effort to switch the souls back into their rightful bodies, which may not be as easy as just getting Rita and the old man proverbially in the same room.

The well-respected Dean of Philosophy at a women's college, she is currently on sabbatical to write her latest book. Although her first husband Sam died tragically 14 years ago from a mixture of alcohol and pills, she has recently married Ken, who had pursued her while he was still married to someone else and his writer friend Larry also professed his love for her. She has a good relationship with her stepdaughter Laura, seemingly better than Laura's relationships with either Ken or Kathy, her volatile mother. Between her and her brother Paul, Marion always had the attention of their academic father, and she and Ken have a wide circle of friends with whom they regularly, willingly socialize. But a series of incidents with these people in her life makes Marion wonder about the decisions that she's made, most specifically whether her cerebral and judgmental nature has been alienating to those around her. One of these incidents is her surprise reunion with her best childhood friend, actress Claire. But arguably the most illuminating incidents involve encounters with Hope, a despondent patient of her workspace neighbor, a psychiatrist whose therapy sessions Marion can hear through the building's ventilation system. Will Marion be fully able to comprehend the extent to which these decisions have negatively affected her life and relationships? If so, can she make the necessary changes at this stage in her life path to be more fulfilled?","['Gena Rowlands', 'Mia Farrow', 'Ian Holm', 'Blythe Danner', 'Gene Hackman']","['Sam Bruskin', 'Michael DeCasper', 'Lisa Fisher', 'Mark Friedberg', 'Peter Lombardi']",['Woody Allen'],['United States'],['English'],['Jack Rollins & Charles H.

85475,"They say rock 'n' roll never dies, but one dark night in 1964, Eddie Wilson's car went off a Jersey bridge with the troubled rock idol at the wheel. His body was never found despite a massive search. Twenty years after the lead singer of Eddie and the Cruisers disappeared, the band's songs are hotter than ever. And renewed interest in the band leads television reporter Maggie Foley to pursue a tantalizing mystery: What if Eddie is still alive? The circumstances surrounding his death are just shadowy enough to make it a distinct possibility, and someone (could it be Eddie?) has been ransacking the homes of the surviving band members in a desperate search for tapes of the group's visionary, never-released album. As Maggie interviews the former band members, the pieces of the puzzle becomes suitable - but only until still deeper mysteries begin to surface.","['Tom Berenger', 'Michael Paré', 'Joe Pantoliano', 'Matthew Laurance', 'Helen Schneider']","['Diana Adams', 'Vebe Borge', 'Mary Ann Braubach', 'Jack Brubach', 'Sarah Carson']",['Martin Davidson'],['United States'],['English'],['Aurora']

97457,"A semi-fictionalized account of the early career of Jerry Lee Lewis is presented. The year is 1956, and he, as the front man, is trying to break into the business in a combo with among others his cousin, J.W. Brown, playing his rollicking version of the music he has always been interested in: what he heard emanating from the black honky-tonks of the south. Success and what goes along with it - fame and money - are arguably foremost on his mind. Against the many odds, he is able to gain that success, the odds including the Christian moral majority largely denouncing his type of music - hard driving rock 'n' roll - as that of the devil and thus anti-Christian, with one of his most vocal opponents with regard to his music being another cousin, sidewalk evangelist Jimmy Swaggart. He may derail his own success in his reckless behavior, especially falling prey to his urges with adoring young female fans, the most scandalous relationship being with J.W. and his wife Lois' thirteen year old daughter, Myra Gale Brown, who would go on imminently to become Myra Lewis, aka Mrs. Jerry Lee Lewis, and who in part was looking for a protector in her fear during this nuclear age.","['Dennis Quaid', 'Winona Ryder', 'John Doe', 'Stephen Tobolowsky', 'Trey Wilson']","['Dan Appleby', 'Jere Barrier', 'Jamaine Bell', 'Beth Bernstein', 'Irene Brafstein']",['Jim McBride'],['United States'],['English'],['Orion Pictures']

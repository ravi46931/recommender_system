101969,"The intertwined stories of a group of Angelenos are told, the stories largely a lament of Los Angeles being a city not their own, if it ever was. The stories are also split largely by the Black/white race divide. Centered on the Black side is Simon, a widowed tow-truck driver with a deaf daughter away at college. Simon has an understanding of the gang violence that surrounds his neighborhood, especially as his teenage nephew Otis--Simon's single-mother sister Deborah's eldest offspring--is part of a gang, believing that he must in order to survive in the short-term, regardless of the consequences. Centered on the white side is Mack, an immigration lawyer who acts largely on impulse only thinking of the implications of his actions after the fact, if at all. He also has an unconscious need to be liked. An example of this is something he does for Jane, a friend of his paralegal Dee, only seconds after he first meets her. Dee understands his actions but doesn't like them. Mack's wife Claire is at a crossroads in life; their 15-year-old son Roberto needs his parents less and less. What Claire sees as a sign to renew her life is only the most visible issue in a long line of issues that demonstrate the unspoken problems in their marriage. The one person whose story is told that is somewhat outside of this lament is Mack's best friend Davis, a successful producer whose movies, as per his want, must have the ""money shot"" of the proverbial and literal head exploding in whatever violent action.","['Danny Glover', 'Kevin Kline', 'Steve Martin', 'Mary McDonnell', 'Mary-Louise Parker']","['Malek Abdul-Mansour', 'Todd J.

She is up front about being a woman with a past, she only becoming wealthy and thus glamorous because of the marriage. Her personal solicitor Sir Simon Flaquer refers the case to his colleague Tony Keane. In spending time with Mrs. Paradise in prison, Tony is immediately attracted to her, that attraction which morphs into obsession. As such, Tony does whatever he can to clear her of the charges, either in mounting a defense of suicide, assisted or not, or that someone else killed him, the most likely candidate being the Colonel's trusted valet, Andre Latour, with who Tony initially believes Mrs. Paradise was having an affair. In the process, Tony may be blinded to the evidence as it presents itself. Who can see what is going on is Tony's wife Gay Keane, who not only believes their marriage has been a perfect one up to this point, but that he truly does believe his obsession with Mrs. Paradine being love, which Gay herself does not believe it to be. Gay can only stand by and hope for a specific verdict in the case so that Tony can return to her wholeheartedly without the specter of Mrs. Paradine hanging over their marriage.","['Gregory Peck', 'Ann Todd', 'Charles Laughton', 'Charles Coburn', 'Ethel Barrymore']","['Lydia Schiller', 'David O.

The stars include: good ol' boy Haven Hamilton, whose patriotic songs leading up to the American bicentennial belie his controlling and ruthless nature; Barbara Jean, the country music darling who is just returning to Nashville and performing following recovery from a fire-related injury which may have taken more of an emotional toll than a physical one; and good looking and charismatic Tom Frank, one-third of the successful group Bill, Mary, and Tom, he who is trying to go solo, which masks his need to not be solo in his personal life as he emotionally abuses woman after woman in love with him, including Mary who is married to Bill. The wannabe stars include: Albuquerque, whose real name is Winifred, who is trying to run away from her husband Star in he not approving of her career choice; and Sueleen Gay, a waitress who will do anything to make it big in music despite being told directly that she has no singing talent.

Jones, who is in town to visit her hospitalized ailing aunt, but who instead decides to be a groupie to any country music star she can find.","['David Arkin', 'Barbara Baxley', 'Ned Beatty', 'Karen Black', 'Ronee Blakley']","['Stephen Altman', 'Jac Cashin', 'Elaine Di Bello Bradish', 'Angel Dominguez', 'Mark Eggenweiler']",['Robert Altman'],['United States'],['English'],"['ABC Entertainment', 'American Broadcasting Company', 'Paramount Pictures']"

90830,"Having taught at the best institutions in the country aside from other more eclectic jobs, James Leeds, with progressive methods, has just started teaching at a school for the deaf on an island off the New England coast, where he is assigned primarily to a speech class for the upper grades. At the school, he quickly notices the young cleaning woman, who he learns is twenty-five year old Sarah Norman and who, deaf herself, was once a student there and has been there since the age of five. He can see that she is bright, headstrong and angry, on top of which she doesn't speak, the latter issues a result of a troubled home life, her mother, her only touchstone to family, who she has purposefully not seen in eight years. As he is able to get through to most of his students to feel more and more comfortable in speaking for a more holistic life, Jim, with the reluctant blessing of the school's superintendent Dr. Curtis Franklin, who has always and still considers Sarah a proverbial pain in the you-know-where, tries to get Sarah to learn how to speak so that she can reach her full potential beyond being a cleaning woman, which he will further learn is a choice if only as it allows her to live her life somewhat in solitude in her silence and anger. Although unable to break through to her on the speaking side of the equation, he is able to break through on a more humanistic level as they end up falling for each other eventually embark on a relationship. The question then becomes if there is the possibility of a long term future for them, especially in being able to bridge their many divides - not only the divide between the world of the hearing and the deaf - and in Sarah never having had a sense of who she truly is as a complete human being and not just the deaf girl who may now see what Jim is doing as solely his latest ""project"".","['William Hurt', 'Marlee Matlin', 'Piper Laurie', 'Philip Bosco', 'Allison Gompf']","['Alan R.

Brutish Bytes, his ""owner"", only wants whatever he can get economically by presenting Merrick as a freak.

Treves initially believes Bytes' assertion that mute Merrick is an imbecile, but ultimately learns that Merrick can speak and is a well-read and articulate man. As news of Merrick hits the London newspapers, he becomes a celebrated curiosity amongst London's upper class, including with Mrs. Kendal, a famed actress. Despite treated much more humanely, the question becomes whether Treves' actions are a further exploitation of Merrick. And as Merrick becomes more famous, others try to get their two-cents worth from who still remains a curiosity and a freak to most, including to Bytes, who has since lost his meal ticket.","['Anthony Hopkins', 'John Hurt', 'Anne Bancroft', 'John Gielgud', 'Wendy Hiller']","['Randy Auerbach', 'Loretta Ordewer', 'John Trehy', 'Ellen Adolph', 'John William Ault']",['David Lynch'],"['United States', 'United Kingdom']","['English', 'French']",['Brooksfilms']

Long having retired, James Whale, arguably most famous for directing Frankenstein (1931) and The Bride of Frankenstein (1935) among some other 1930s horror classics, has burned his bridges with the Hollywood community in that they have abandoned him, the possible exception being his continuing friendship with former lover David Lewis. James had been openly gay even during his working period and is in declining health. Having been recently released from a hospital where he was recuperating from a stroke, he left with some permanent health issues, the aftermath of the stroke. Much against the disapproval of his loyal longtime housekeeper Hanna, his health does not prevent him from toying with the handsome young men who may wander into his midst in his continuing homosexual desires, although Hanna is as much, if not more concerned about any of those young men taking advantage of him in his elderly and fragile state. The young man who catches his eye among the most recent is Clayton Boone, who Hanna had hired to do garden work around the property. Clay, an ex-marine from the proverbial ""wrong side of the tracks"", has no idea who James was or is before he starts this job. James and Clay soon begin a friendship of sorts. Clay is also unaware of James' homosexual orientation before such is confirmed by Hanna, an issue which threatens his masculinity, especially in light of the cracks showing in his casual sexual relationship with a slightly older and wiser diner waitress named Betty. Clay has to reconcile that threat against being in the company of someone whom he considers an interesting and once famous man. The friendship and his state of health related to the stroke lead James to reflect in a bittersweet vein on key points of his life, most notably serving in WWI, and as a result reveals his ulterior motives through the actions he takes toward Clay.","['Ian McKellen', 'Brendan Fraser', 'Lynn Redgrave', 'Lolita Davidovich', 'David Dukes']","['Joe Abele', 'Allison Andrade', 'Leonardo Arterberry III', 'Brian Askew', 'Shaher Batroukh']",['Bill Condon'],"['United States', 'United Kingdom']","['English', 'Hungarian']","['Lions Gate Films', 'Showtime Networks', 'Flashpoint (I)', 'BBC Films', 'Regent Entertainment', 'BBC Films', 'Regent Entertainment', 'Spike Productions']"

87688,"Father Tim Farley, who presides over St. Francis Church, is arguably the most popular priest within the diocese led by Monsignor Thomas Burke, Father Farley's popularity as witnessed by the size and enthusiasm of the congregation at his church services. Many see Monsignor Burke as autocratic, he having a very narrow and traditionally conservative view of the church in addition. Father Farley often socializes with Monsignor Burke, the two most recently having gone on vacation together to Yugoslavia, but Father Farley sees this socializing more as a professional obligation than a true want, Father Farley who will tell what he considers little white lies to get out of many of those social commitments. Father Farley will tell those little white lies in more circumstances to achieve his desired end, those lies of which his devoted, loyal and devout housekeeper Margaret refuses to be a part. Although not having much to do with the diocese's seminary, Father Farley plea bargains with the Monsignor to ordain seminarian Mark Dolson as a deacon, the Monsignor's condition being only if he is to be the deacon at St. Francis for a one month probation period. The Monsignor's original want not to ordain Mark is because Mark often openly challenges what church elders tell him, the Monsignor feeling that Mark not having the temperament not only to be a deacon but more importantly a priest. Although Father Farley had seen Mark's challenges first hand and thus sees him as much as a pain in the neck as most of those at the seminary do, he came to Mark's defense in this matter if only in not agreeing with the Monsignor's open and closed judgment of Mark, the judgment solely because Mark often disagreed with his views. In spending time with Mark, Father Farley finds that Mark doesn't have a filter between his thoughts/emotions and what comes out of his mouth, in turn the congregation as a collective not having the best initial opinion of him. A series of events leads to a specific incident placing Mark's position in the church at risk. As such, Father Farley has to make a decision about how far he is willing to go to defend Mark at the risk of his own personal and professional standing. In the process, Father Farley may have to examine his own many imperfections as a priest and a human being.","['Jack Lemmon', 'Zeljko Ivanek', 'Charles Durning', 'Louise Latham', 'Alice Hirson']","['Joseph Battaglia', 'Kathleen Long', 'Ira S.

When a raucous conflict with the store's cruelly incompetent therapist, Granville Sawyer, erupts, he finds himself held at Bellevue where, in despair, he deliberately fails a mental examination to ensure his commitment. All seems lost until Doris' neighbor, Fred Gailey, reassures him of his worth and agrees to represent him in the fight to secure his release. To achieve that, Fred arranges a formal hearing in which he argues that Kris is sane because he is in fact Santa Claus.

Luca has lived in an orphanage since his dressmaker mother's death, death a concept that Luca does not yet understand. As such, he often runs away looking for his mother. On a mutual agreement between Paolo and Mary, Mary becomes Luca's guardian, she who will receive help in raising Luca by her fellow Scorpioni and financial help from Paolo as needed.

Luca, who has just returned to Italy after attending school in Austria, helps Elsa with her efforts to assist those persecuted in Italy. Luca, now a teenager, has fallen in love with Elsa. As such, Luca is jealous of Elsa's professional and personal relationship with Italian lawyer Vittorio Fanfanni (Paolo Seganti). Elsa's own situation becomes more precarious with the United States' entrance into the war, the Nazis' increasing persecution of Jews, and Luca discovering that Fanfanni has ulterior motives in his relationship with Elsa. Through it all, Mary still tries to be the voice of what is right to Luca, who may be tainted by his own immature teenaged thoughts during these difficult times.","['Cher', 'Judi Dench', 'Joan Plowright', 'Maggie Smith', 'Lily Tomlin']","['Tommaso Arrighi', 'Marco Billeri', 'Rebecca Booth', 'Robert Booth', 'Roberto Canaro']",['Franco Zeffirelli'],"['Italy', 'United Kingdom']","['English', 'Italian']","['Medusa Film', 'Cattleya', 'Cineritmo', 'Film and General Productions']"

Beyond life without Donald, they are all nervous about starting a new life, which, for Charlene, means getting back into the workforce after thirteen years. Milly quickly settles into the neighborhood if only because she becomes fascinated with their next door neighbor, teen-aged Eric Gibb, who authorities believe is autistic.

Many believe Eric's belief is because he felt he could thus save his parents. Eric's guardian is his dipsomaniac Uncle Hugo Gibb.

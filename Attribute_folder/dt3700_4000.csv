101465,"1634, New France. Nearing the onset of winter, French Jesuit priest Father Laforgue, one of the younger ones in the settlement founded by explorer Samuel de Champlain, is embarking on a journey estimated to be 1,500 miles largely by canoe, to discover what happened to the missionary settlement meant to convert the Huron to Christianity. He is accompanied by non-Jesuit laborer Daniel, who hopes, from this experience, to be able to work toward being ordained upon returning to France, and a tribe of Algonquins who are acting as his guides, not only in navigating the geography, but arguably more importantly liaising with other indigenous tribes they will ultimately encounter along the way. Champlain himself and the older priests in the settlement view this mission as one from which Laforgue will never return alive. One of the reasons is the general distrust between the Jesuits and the indigenous population, even the generally peaceful Algonquin, some who consider Laforgue a demon in not understanding his rituals around his faith. Conversely, Laforgue does not try to understand his guides, but rather know their rituals so as to at least work with them. While the Jesuits live by their faith in a global sense, the indigenous tribes have their own faith largely tied to a sense of place, which will affect what happens between Laforgue and the Algonquin on the trek. Another issue is the enemy status between some of the tribes, especially the Iroquois, with those tribes arguably having a difficult time losing what has long been their kill or be killed mentality. Adding to the complications is Daniel falling in love with Annuka, an Algonquin, their relationship which only makes Laforgue question his own faith.","['Lothaire Bluteau', 'Aden Young', 'Sandrine Holt', 'August Schellenberg', 'Tantoo Cardinal']","['Annabelle Alvarez', 'Joe C.W.

60668,"July 13, 1808 at the Charenton Insane Asylum just outside Paris. The inmates of the asylum are mounting their latest theatrical production, written and produced by who is probably the most famous inmate of the facility, the Marquis de Sade. The asylum's director, M. Coulmier, a supporter of the current French regime led by Napoleon, encourages this artistic expression as therapy for the inmates, while providing the audience - the aristocracy - a sense that they are being progressive in inmate treatments. Coulmier as the master of ceremonies, his wife and daughter in special places of honor, and the cast, all of whom are performing the play in the asylum's bath house, are separated from the audience by prison bars. The play is a retelling of a period in the French Revolution culminating with the assassination exactly fifteen years earlier of revolutionary Jean-Paul Marat by peasant girl, Charlotte Corday. The play is to answer whether Marat was a friend or foe to the people of France. In the primary roles are a paranoiac with a skin condition (much as Marat had himself) as Marat, a narcoleptic with melancholia as Corday, and a sexual manic as M. Dupere. Coulmier feels he needs to intervene anytime during the performance when things get out of hand. The Marquis may have ulterior motives in the telling of this story, he who plays a large role on stage, especially in his discussions with the Marat character about the nature of the revolution and the differences in their individual motives concerning the revolution. As the inmates perform a story of revolution, they may subconsciously be sucked into the story mirroring their own struggles with authority. Real life and the actors' afflictions may also dictate how the performance turns out.","['Patrick Magee', 'Ian Richardson', 'Michael Williams', 'Clifford Rose', 'Glenda Jackson']","['Malcolm Goddard', 'Diana Stanley']",['Peter Brook'],['United Kingdom'],['English'],"['Marat Sade Productions', 'Royal Shakespeare Company']"

One of the members' sister, Elisabeth, needs a new place to stay with her children after having had enough of her alcoholic and abusive husband. Elisabeth is neither a socialist nor a feminist nor into the green movement but ends up loving living in the community where they all learn from each other. The film makes a little fun of people with strong ideals and ""square"" minds whether they be vegans, communists or people who absolutely disgust vegans or socialists. In the end, the message of the film is that people can grow and gain from bonding with each other. It also shows how we need to shape up a little for this to work, either through working on our behaviour that affects other people badly (like alcoholism or abuse) or the need to set boundaries and not let other people walk all over oneself.","['Lisa Lindgren', 'Michael Nyqvist', 'Emma Samuelsson', 'Sam Kessel', 'Gustaf Hammarsten']","['Jonas Andersson', 'Lise-Lotte Book', 'Benny Carlsson', 'Anders Claesson', 'Jon Ekstrand']",['Lukas Moodysson'],"['Sweden', 'Denmark', 'Italy']",['Swedish'],"['Memfis Film', 'Zentropa Entertainments', 'Film i Väst', 'SVT Drama, Göteborg', 'Nordisk Film & TV-Fond', 'Svenska Filminstitutet (SFI)', 'Det Danske Filminstitut', 'TV1000 AB']"

He is there to follow up on a letter addressed specifically to him from an anonymous source on Summerisle reporting that a twelve year old girl who lives on the island, Rowan Morrison, the daughter of May Morrison, has long been missing. The correspondence includes a photograph of Rowan. Upon his arrival on Summerisle, Howie finds that the locals are a seemingly simple minded lot who provide little information beyond the fact that they know of no Rowan Morrison and do not know the girl in the photo. Mrs. Morrison admits to having a daughter, seven year old Myrtle, but no Rowan. As Howie speaks to more and more people, he begins to believe that Rowan does or did live on the island, but that the locals are hiding their knowledge of her. He also begins to see that the locals all have pagan beliefs, their ""religion"" which centers on procreation as the source of life. That procreation does not necessarily need to be within marriage, and openly flaunts the act of sex, both in private and in public. These beliefs do not sit well against Howie's strict Christian morals, he who regularly attends church, prays, and accepts communion. Everything that happens on the island seems to be dictated by Lord Summerisle, whose ancestors bought the island generations ago. Howie begins to believe that Rowan was murdered, she a sacrifice by the islanders to their higher power to ensure a bountiful apple crop - the main crop of the island - which did not materialize last season. With May Day approaching, Howie not only tries to find out if Rowan was indeed murdered/sacrificed, which includes trying to locate her body, but if there will be another sacrifice on this important day within the cycle of life.","['Edward Woodward', 'Christopher Lee', 'Diane Cilento', 'Britt Ekland', 'Ingrid Pitt']","['Micheline Charest', 'Larry Gordon', 'Beryl Harvey', 'Stuart Hopps', 'Frank Law']",['Robin Hardy'],['United Kingdom'],['English'],['British Lion Film Corporation']

His mission begins with the unlikely delivery of a cat to a small outer-belt asteroid saloon where he meets his former dance partner, and renowned interplanetary fruit thief, the Blueberry Pirate. As payment for his delivery of the cat, Curtis receives a homemade cloning device already in the process of creating a creature most rare in this space quadrant... a Real Live Girl. At the suggestion of the Blueberry Pirate, Curtis takes the Real Live Girl to Jupiter where women have long been a mystery. There, he proposes a trade with the owner of Jupiter: the Real Live Girl clone for the Boy Who Actually Saw A Woman's Breast. The Boy Who Actually Saw A Woman's Breast is regarded as royalty on the all-male mining planet of Jupiter because of his unique and exotic contact with a woman. It is Curtis' intention to take The Boy to Venus and trade him for the remains of Johnny R., a man who spent his lifetime serving as a human stud for the Southern belles of Venus, a planet populated only by women. Upon returning Johnny R's body to his bereaved family on earth, Curtis will receive a handsome reward. It all seems simple enough. But while hashing out the plan with the Blueberry Pirate, Curtis is spotted by his nemesis, Professor Hess. Possessed by an enigmatic obsession with Curtis, Heiss is capable of killing without reason, unless his intended victim is someone with whom he has unresolved issues. Heiss has been pursuing Samuel Curtis throughout the solar system in order that he might forgive him, then kill him. Along the way, Heiss has executed each and every individual to come into contact with Curtis. Unaware of this danger, Curtis sets forth on his mission. After retrieving The Boy Who Actually Saw A Woman's Breast from Jupiter, Curtis is contacted by Professor Heiss, who makes his intentions known. Fearful, Curtis and The Boy look for a place to hide. They come across a primitive space station constructed by Nevada State silver miners from the late 1800s. Inside they discover a small group of miners still alive, their bodies crippled and deformed by space atrophy. Unable to return home for fear that Earth's gravity would kill them, two of the miners mated and give birth to a boy known as Bodysuit. He has been raised in a suit of hydraulics to simulate Earth's gravity with the intention of eventually sending him home. In trade for supplies and sanctuary, Curtis agrees to deliver Bodysuit to Earth. Once they land on the lush planet of Venus, the terrain dramatically changes, and Curtis is inspired by a plan. And it may just happen that in a solar system ruled by commerce and danger, sometimes good can prevail.","['Cory McAbee', 'Rocco Sisto', 'Gregory Russell Cook', 'Annie Golden', 'James Ransone']","['Alan Aguilar', 'Percy Lee Anderson', 'Nuri Bell', 'Winston Binch', 'Carol Binion']",['Cory McAbee'],['United States'],['English'],"['BNS Productions', 'Commodore Films']"

TV producer Tommy, who's just broken up with his girlfriend, has a short relationship with commitment-phobe Maria, who he meets in a video store, and also hooks up with married real-estate agent Annie, who he meets while apartment hunting. Annie is open to a relationship because her husband, Griffin, is cheating on her, which she slowly comes to realize through talking to her friend/co-worker who's gone through the same thing. Griffin, a 39-year-old dentist, is cheating with 19-year-old waitress Ashley, who he picked up in a park; she realizes she can do better when Ben, a hotel doorman and aspiring musician, tries to pick her up, in a belated attempt to recover from his divorce a year ago from schoolteacher Maria (the same Maria from the video store).

Jon had invited Vince to town from his current residence of Oakland to help celebrate the fact of his latest movie, independently shot, having a screening at the local film festival the following day, the first public screening of one of his movies. While Jon seems to have grown up in having this career path and a nice room in an upscale hotel provided by the festival, Vince, who, in preparing for the evening has already had a few beer by the time Jon arrives, hasn't, he who deals drugs for a living with no change on the horizon, and his girlfriend, who was supposed to accompany him to Lansing, having broken up with him, indirectly because of his immaturity. This divergence quickly becomes an issue of contention between the two. But as Vince's behavior is seemingly more and more substance affected, he having broken out the weed and coke, his intention with Jon may be clearer than it appears on the surface, it having to do with an issue from high school which always seems to emerge in some respect every time they meet. That issue begins to hit home for Jon with a specific action by Vince. But everything may take a turn onto its head with the arrival onto the scene of a third - Amy - also a friend from high school involved in that issue ten years ago, she, now an Assistant D.A. in Lansing, who Vince had invited without Jon's knowledge and who Jon has not seen since high school.","['Ethan Hawke', 'Robert Sean Leonard', 'Uma Thurman']","['Paul Brennan', 'Paola Cicchini', 'Brent Cox', 'Jacqueline Eckhouse', 'Debi Fieldman']",['Richard Linklater'],['United States'],['English'],"['Detour Filmproduction', 'IFC Productions', 'InDigEnt', 'Tape Productions Inc.', 'The Independent Film Channel Productions']"

A ten-year-old boy named Carlos, the son of a fallen Republican war hero, is left by his tutor in an orphanage in the middle of nowhere. The orphanage is run by a curt but considerate headmistress named Carmen and a kindly Professor Casares, both of whom are sympathetic to the doomed Republican cause. Despite their concern for him, and his gradual triumph over the usual schoolhouse bully, Carlos never feels completely comfortable in his new environment. First of all, there was that initial encounter with the orphanage's nasty caretaker, Jacinto, who reacts even more violently when anyone is caught looking around a particular storage room the one with the deep well. Second, and more inexplicable, is the presence of a ghost, one of the former occupants of the orphanage named Santi. Not long after Carlos' arrival, Santi latches onto Carlos, badgering him incessantly at night and gloomily intoning, ""Many of you will die."" As if that wasn't enough to keep the orphanage's occupants in an unrelenting state of terror, there's the un-exploded bomb that dominates the orphanage's courtyard, still ticking away; With the orphanage left defenseless by its isolation, and the swift progression of Franco's troops, the ghost's prediction seems depressingly accurate. Nevertheless, with every step of the plot, it becomes apparent that the ghost's predictions as to who (or what) will die, the real source of danger and even the definition of death itself may be more ambiguous than first thought.","['Marisa Paredes', 'Eduardo Noriega', 'Federico Luppi', 'Fernando Tielve', 'Íñigo Garcés']","['Alfonso Aguirre', 'Conchita Araña', 'Yolanda Cáceres', 'Fabio Diéguez', 'Adela Donamaría']",['Guillermo del Toro'],"['Spain', 'Mexico']",['Spanish'],"['El Deseo', 'Tequila Gang', 'Sogepaq', 'Canal+ España', 'Anhelo Producciones']"

Police detective Leon Zat and his wife Sonja Zat probably still love each other but have not stated to each other the problems that have invaded their marriage. Those problems not only affect their relationship, but also the way they parent their two teenage sons. Leon's single partner, Detective Claudia Weis, can probably most clearly see those problems, but is not equipped to be a good informal counselor to him in she considering the eye contact with another regular at the diner she frequents as being a somewhat committed relationship. A bundle of repressed emotions, Leon vents through mostly inappropriate acts of aggression, and having just embarked in an extramarital affair with Jane O'May, the recently separated woman in the same salsa dance class as him and Sonja. Jane initiated that separation from her husband, Pete O'May, in coming to the realization one day that she no longer loved him for whatever reason. Jane still craves human connection, she who may view her affair with Leon differently than him. The O'Mays' marital problems affect their next door neighbors, Nik and Paula D'Amato, who are friends with both and do not want to betray one in helping the other. Nik and Paula are outwardly happy despite their financial problems, with unemployed Nik looking after their three preschool age children while Paula works double shifts to put food on the table. Regardless, Nik still needs his respite away from that role as stay-at-home dad. Sonja's emotional outlet is being in therapy with Dr. Valerie Somers, something that she has not told Leon. Valerie is overcoming her own grief in her then eleven year old daughter, Eleanor Knox, having been found murdered eighteen months ago. While she wrote a just published book about Eleanor as a process to deal with her grief, Valerie's husband, law professor John Knox, quietly says he will do anything to support her. The murder has undoubtedly affected their marriage in a certain emotional and physical distance having formed between them. Among Valerie's clients is gay Patrick Phelan, who is dealing with the extramarital affair he is having with a man in a heterosexual marriage. Valerie's own problems with John affect the way she deals with Patrick, who can see her dislike of him but may not understand the full extent of the reason. These collective stories become even more intertwined when one within this collective goes missing, foul play suspected. What happens in the investigation is affected by the emotional issues each of the players is dealing with beyond the fact of that person being missing.","['Anthony LaPaglia', 'Rachael Blake', 'Kerry Armstrong', 'Manu Bennett', 'Melissa Martinez']","['Mauricio Alpizar', 'Teresa Barker', 'Anni Browning', 'Lazaro Cifuentes', 'Nicholas Copping']",['Ray Lawrence'],"['Australia', 'Germany']","['English', 'Spanish']","['MBP', 'Jan Chapman Productions', 'Australian Film Finance Corporation', 'The New South Wales Film and Television Office']"

Just when everything seems to be going his way, it is discovered that he (unwittingly) attended a Communist meeting during college when dragged there by his girlfriend at the time; thus, heavy suspicion settles over him and he must stand before Congress. Afraid of what might happen if they don't, HHS cancels Appleton's contract and aborts the film's release.

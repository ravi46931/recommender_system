56058,"Peace in 17th-century Japan causes the Shogunate's breakup of warrior clans, throwing thousands of samurai out of work and into poverty. An honorable end to such fate under the samurai code is ritual suicide, or hara-kiri (self-inflicted disembowelment). An elder warrior, Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) seeks admittance to the house of a feudal lord to commit the act. There, he learns of the fate of his son-in-law, a young samurai who sought work at the house but was instead barbarically forced to commit traditional hara-kiri in an excruciating manner with a dull bamboo blade. In flashbacks the samurai tells the tragic story of his son-in-law, and how he was forced to sell his real sword to support his sick wife and child. Tsugumo thus sets in motion a tense showdown of revenge against the house.","['Tatsuya Nakadai', 'Akira Ishihama', 'Shima Iwashita', 'Tetsurô Tanba', 'Masao Mishima']","['Kaneshige Inokuma', 'Ryôzô Nakamura', 'Sofu Teshigahara']",['Masaki Kobayashi'],['Japan'],['Japanese'],['Shochiku']

56262,"It's the early 20th-century American Midwest. A con man going by the assumed name Harold Hill has used several different schemes to bilk the unsuspecting, and now travels from town to town pretending to be a professor of music - from the Gary (Indiana) Conservatory of Music, class of '05 - who solves all the respective towns' youth problems by forming boys' marching bands. He takes money from the townsfolk to buy instruments, music, instructional materials, and uniforms for their sons. However, in reality, he has no degree and knows nothing about music, and after all the materials arrive and are distributed, he absconds with all the money, never to be seen again. Many of the traveling salesmen in the territory have been negatively impacted by him, as the townsfolk then become suspicious of any stranger trying to sell them something. For Harold's scheme to work, he must gain the trust of the local music teacher, usually by wooing her, regardless of her appearance. And if the town doesn't believe it has a youth problem needing to be fixed, he will manufacture one for them. That is the case when he arrives in River City, Iowa, population 2,212, where he will have some unexpected help from Marcellus Washburn, a friend and former grifter colleague who now lives in River City and has gone straight, but he still wants to make sure Harold survives his stay in town. River City's music teacher is spinster and town librarian Marian Paroo. He's able to impress all the other River Citizens with his fast-talking sales pitches, but not suspicious Marian, whose hard-as-nails exterior is unlike all the other River Citizens. Her exterior is partly due to her somewhat removed standing in the town, as all the gossipy housewives believe she is a smut peddler - encouraging the teenagers to read authors such as Chaucer and Balzac - and mistakenly believe that she got her position as librarian through less-than-scrupulous means. What Harold does not know is that one way to Marian is through her young adolescent brother, Winthrop Paroo, a sullen boy who has withdrawn from life since their father's death two years before, when he started to lisp. Harold starts to fall for Marian, something that never happened with any of the other music teachers. Further complications may ensue if any of those traveling salesmen who have been following his route through the territory catch up with and expose him.","['Robert Preston', 'Shirley Jones', 'Buddy Hackett', 'Hermione Gingold', 'Paul Ford']","['Kermit Bloomgarden', 'Herbert Greene', 'Tom Panko', 'Onna White', 'Robert E.

He also chooses not to socialize because of his situation and needing to make the long daily commute to/from Ceyrat, where he currently lives. He has had his fair share of women during his adult life and now chooses to adhere most closely to his Catholic beliefs in approaching romantic and sexual relationships with women with the sole goal of love and marriage. He keeps seeing a pretty blonde at Mass on Sunday mornings and without knowing her or even talking to her, he believes that this woman is destined to be his wife. He has been reading the writings of Blaise Pascal and finding the mixture of mathematics and Catholicism just what he needs to be reading and applying to his life.

If he does stay true to his thoughts of the blonde, he could find that a happily-ever-after with her is not a guarantee, and she might have her own baggage.","['Jean-Louis Trintignant', 'Françoise Fabian', 'Marie-Christine Barrault', 'Antoine Vitez', 'Léonide Kogan']","['Pierre Grimberg', 'Eymeric Jorat']",['Éric Rohmer'],['France'],['French'],"['Compagnie Française de Distribution Cinématographique (CFDC)', 'Union Générale Cinématographique (UGC)', 'Sirius', 'Pathé', 'Les Films du Losange', 'Les Films du Carrosse', 'Les Films des deux mondes', 'Les Films de la Pléiade', 'Les Productions de la Guéville', 'Renn Productions', 'Simar Films', 'FFD', 'Société Française de Production', 'Two World Entertainment']"

A strange pyramid has appeared over the city; inside, the gods of ancient Egypt have judged Horus, one of their fellow gods, to cease his immortality. In the city below, Jill, a young woman with blue hair, is arrested. She is not completely human; her tissues appear to be no more than a few months old according to an examining physician, although her physical form is already that of an adult. She also possesses a number of secret powers, including one that enables her to procreate with gods, though she knows nothing of this. Horus is given a limited time to interact with the humans of New York and procreate. During his search for a host body, Horus encounters Nikopol, a rebel condemned to thirty years of hibernation who, due to a mechanical accident, escapes his prison one year early. Horus has been unsuccessful in attempting to take over the bodies of other humans; due to an incompatibility with the genetic alterations humans have undergone, the host bodies self-destruct while attempting to accommodate a god. Nikopol's body is acceptable as it has been frozen in prison/storage and not undergone the genetic changes causing the rejections. Horus takes partial control of Nikopol's body and starts looking for a woman he can mate with to provide him a son before his death sentence is carried out. When Horus/Nikopol discovers Jill, they become entangled in a web of murder and intrigue.","['Linda Hardy', 'Thomas Kretschmann', 'Charlotte Rampling', 'Yann Collette', 'Frédéric Pierrot']","['Julie Adams', 'Jérôme Arthuis', 'Sophie Bernard', 'Stéphane Bourdon', 'Thomas Capelle']",['Enki Bilal'],"['France', 'Italy', 'United Kingdom']","['English', 'French']","['Téléma', 'TF1 Films Production', 'CiBy 2000', 'RF2K Productions', 'Force Majeure Productions', 'Medusa Film', 'TPS Star', 'Cofimage 13', 'Natexis Banques Populaires Images 2', 'Sofica Valor 6', 'World Wonder Ring Stardom']"

372824,"Fond de l'Etang is a boarding school for troubled boys located in the French countryside. In the mid-twentieth century, it is run by the principal M. Rachin, an egotistical disciplinarian whose official unofficial mantra for the school is ""action - reaction"", meaning that there will be severe consequences for any boy out of line. This approach does not seem to be working as the boys as a collective are an unruly bunch. In turn, the teachers don't teach, but are always watching out for the next subversive act from the boys. January 15, 1949 marks the arrival to the school of the new supervisor, M. Clément Mathieu, a middle-aged man who is grasping at finding his place in life after a series of failed endeavors. Although he does find the boys an unruly lot, Mathieu does not believe in the ""action - reaction"" policy, and as such, butts heads with Rachin while secretly undermining the policy. Slowly, Mathieu's approach of trying to match the discipline to the crime does have a positive effect on a handful of students. With the reluctant approval of Rachin, Mathieu begins a grander experiment of trying to transform the overall atmosphere within the school, core within the experiment being to start a choir among his students. This move is a difficult one for him as a failed musician, as well as for the initially reluctant students. During this process, Mathieu focuses on two different students for two different reasons. Pépinot, a younger boy, seems to lack guidance and focus, and who always says he is waiting for Saturday when his father will pick him up, he who never does. And Pierre Morhange, an older student, is the anachronism: introverted, but prone to outbursts of individual subversiveness - the devil with the face of an angel as the other teachers describe him. Behind the reason for his subversiveness, which Mathieu slowly learns, Morhange hides a love of music and a true talent in it. Beyond overcoming the obvious obstacles of Rachin and the students' skepticism and Rachin's egotism, Mathieu has another challenge in newly arrived Pascal Mondain, a truly troubled older boy with pathological tendencies whose presence alone may wreak havoc throughout the school, and not just with Mathieu's project. Over fifty years later, Morhange and Pépinot, who have not seen each other since that time and who did not spend that much time together while at school, are reading through Mathieu's memoirs from his time at the school, which unmasks the reason why the two are privy to the memoir and the effect he had on their lives.","['Gérard Jugnot', 'François Berléand', 'Kad Merad', 'Jean-Paul Bonnaire', 'Marie Bunel']","['Stéphanie Auger', 'Nasser Belkalem', 'Nicolas Dumont', 'Mickael Georgeault', 'Magali Herbinger']",['Christophe Barratier'],"['France', 'Switzerland', 'Germany']",['French'],"['Vega Film', 'Banque Populaire Images 4', 'CP Medien AG', 'Canal+', ""Centre national du cinéma et de l'image animée"", 'Dan Valley Film AG', 'France 2 Cinéma', 'Galatée Films', 'Novo Arturo Films', 'Pathé', 'Renn Productions', 'Société des Producteurs de Cinéma et de Télévision']"

As Keller digs deeper into his eyewitnesses' past and her secretive world of global connections, the more suspicious he becomes that she herself might be involved in the conspiracy.

Though they must depend on one another, Silvia and Tobin couldn't be more different.

389326,"A semiserious, often rollicking, multigenerational insider's look at the origins of surfing, the colorful and subversive birth of surf culture, and the mythology and lure of the big wave. This passionate and fluid film is without question the first authentic history of surfing from its humble Hawaiian beginnings to the big business it became to the still-rebellious universe it inhabits today. Riding Giants is a study in individuality and freedom, the pursuit and techniques of pure kinetic pleasure, and the risk taking and attitudes that characterize its leading figures. For some viewers, this is perhaps more than they ever wanted to know. But Peralta's detailed knowledge of the surfing lifestyle, its icons and locations, its boom and exploitation by the media, and the fascination it has held for young men for more than five decades is unparalleled and fuels this expedition for the expert and initiate alike. Closely chronicling the sometimes-life-and-death drama that big-wave riding entails, Riding Giants is an often-mesmerizing visual thrill ride. But the most appealing aspect of this often revelatory documentary is the realization that the man versus nature dialectic never ends; the search for the ultimate wave and the spiritual pinnacle can only be pursued but never reached.","['Jeff Clark', 'Pat Curren', 'Darrick Doerner', 'Sarah Gerhardt', 'Bill Hamilton']","['Bud Browne', 'Tina Miranda', 'Cecy Rangel', 'Christine Triano']",['Stacy Peralta'],"['United States', 'France']",['English'],"['Agi Orsi Productions', 'Forever Films', 'Quicksilver Entertainment', 'Quiksilver', 'Setsuna LLC', 'StudioCanal']"

In Rwanda, the classification of the native population into Hutus and Tutsis, arbitrarily done by the colonial Belgians, is now ingrained within Rwandan mentality despite the Rwandan independence. Despite the Belgians having placed the Tutsis in a higher position during the Belgian rule, they have placed the majority Hutus in power after independence. Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu married to a Tutsi, Tatiana Rusesabagina, is the House Manager of the Hotel Des Milles Collines in Kigali. The Milles Collines, owned by Sabena (the national airline of Belgium), is a four-star hotel catering primarily to wealthy white westerners. Paul, who knows how to work the system to run the hotel effectively for its guests and for Sabena, is proud that most of the Caucasians who he meets in this professional capacity treat him with respect. After a specific incident, the relative calm between the Tutsi guerrillas and government-backed Hutu militia takes a turn. Paul's thought that the native population as a whole who are not directly involved in the conflict will be protected as the UN peacekeeping forces and thus the world is watching doesn't happen as the western world largely evacuates from Rwanda and abandons the natives. Such begins what will become a genocide of the Tutsi population. Paul, who is able to get his immediate family to the hotel which is still largely seen as a place of sanctuary, will have to use the considerable skills he has used to run the hotel as well as he has instead to keep himself, his family and any others taking refuge at the hotel alive, whether they be Hutu or Tutsi. Meanwhile, Colonel Oliver, a Canadian heading the UN peacekeeping forces, and Pat Archer with the Red Cross do what they can to assist Paul and to get people to safety first to the hotel then out of the country, while field journalists, like photographer Jack Daglish, try to bring the genocide back into the global media to have the world once again care about what is going on.","['Xolani Mali', 'Don Cheadle', 'Desmond Dube', 'Hakeem Kae-Kazim', 'Tony Kgoroge']","['Alison Brister', 'Cher Budd', 'Elaine Burt', 'Sandra Butterworth', 'Rita Dal Chiappa']",['Terry George'],"['United Kingdom', 'South Africa', 'Italy', 'United States']","['English', 'French', 'Kinyarwanda']","['United Artists', 'Lions Gate Films', 'Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa', 'Miracle Pictures', 'Inside Track Films', 'Mikado Film', 'Endgame Entertainment']"

His early movie fame was based primarily on his comic characterizations, often of bumbling and foreign-accented persons, characters which he embodied. As his movie fame rose, he began to lose his own personal identity to his movie characters, leading to self-doubt of himself as a person and a constant need for reassurance and acceptance of his work. This self-doubt manifested itself in fits of anger and what was deemed as arrogance by many. In turn, his personal relationships began to deteriorate as his characterizations were continually used to mask his problems. His first wife, Anne Howe, left/divorced him and his relationships with his parents and children became increasingly distant. His relationship with his second wife, Swedish actress Britt Ekland, was based on this mask. In his later life, he tried to rediscover himself and his career with what would become his penultimate film role, that of Chance in Being There (1979).","['Geoffrey Rush', 'Charlize Theron', 'Emily Watson', 'John Lithgow', 'Miriam Margolyes']","['Carolyn Allen', 'Guy Barker', 'Francesca Castellano', 'Gavin Charlton', 'Paul Donnellon']",['Stephen Hopkins'],"['United Kingdom', 'United States']",['English'],"['HBO Films', 'BBC Films', 'The De Mann Entertainment Company', 'Company Pictures']"

Henry is miserly, dipsomaniacal, and tyrannical, not allowing his daughters to date since their sole purpose in life is to serve him and the shop--for no wages. He changes his mind about Alice and Vicky, for whom he will choose husbands although they've also chosen the men they'd marry if they could. However, Henry won't provide them with dowries, which might be a challenge in finding them men he would consider suitable husbands. He considers Maggie far too useful to him as the overly-efficient, organized one, so doesn't intend to let her go--besides, at age 30, she's too old for any man to want anyway. Incensed by her father's attitude, Maggie decides to show him how wrong he is about her being an unmarriageable spinster by proposing to timid Willie Mossop, the shop's poor, uneducated, illiterate boot hand--yet best bootmaker, apparently better than any bootmaker in nearby Manchester--who has known no other professional life than the shop. They enter into a marriage of convenience. Despite the differences in their social classes, Maggie believes she can show her father that she can find a husband while also forcing him to treat Willie better (and by association her) in paying him decent wages, otherwise she will use her wifely influence to convince Willie to take his and her valuable services elsewhere. If their hands are forced, Maggie believes their best weapon is wealthy, particular Mrs. Hepworth, who said that only Willie shall ever make her boots. Maggie has even taken into consideration what effect her actions will have on her sisters' nuptials, vowing to them that all will be all right in that regard. Although she truly has no idea how her father will react, she hasn't considered Willie, who might already have his own life outside the shop.

The religious wars raging in the far-off Holy Land seem remote to him, yet he is pulled into that immense drama. Amid the pageantry and intrigues of medieval Jerusalem, he falls in love, grows into a leader, and ultimately uses all his courage and skill to defend the city against staggering odds. Destiny comes seeking Balian in the form of a great knight, Godfrey of Ibelin, a Crusader briefly home to France from fighting in the East. Revealing himself as Balian's father, Godfrey shows him the true meaning of knighthood and takes him on a journey across continents to the fabled Holy City. In Jerusalem at that moment--between the Second and Third Crusades--a fragile peace prevails, through the efforts of its enlightened Christian king, Baldwin IV, aided by his advisor Tiberias, and the military restraint of the legendary Muslim leader Saladin Ayubi. But Baldwin's days are numbered, and strains of fanaticism, greed, and jealousy among the Crusaders threaten to shatter the truce. King Baldwin's vision of peace--a kingdom of heaven--is shared by a handful of knights, including Godfrey of Ibelin, who swear to uphold it with their lives and honor. As Godfrey passes his sword to his son, he also passes on that sacred oath: to protect the helpless, safeguard the peace, and work toward harmony between religions and cultures, so that a kingdom of heaven can flourish on earth.

Like many of the white in the area, he does not associate with the Inuit except for what he can get out of them in bartering. On a personal plane trip, he runs across a small family of nomadic Inuit. The female of the group, named Kanaalaq, has what Charlie suspects is tuberculosis. In exchange for some ivory, Charlie agrees to fly her to a hospital in Yellowknife. En route back to the city, Charlie is forced to make a crash landing when the plane develops mechanical problems. Although both Charlie and Kanaalaq are unharmed by the crash, the plane is totaled, they are in the middle of nowhere, the radio doesn't seem to be working, they have a meager amount of supplies, and Charlie's whereabouts are probably unknown to others since he made a detour from his original route. Furthermore, they can't communicate with each other as Kanaalaq only knows a few words of English, whereas Charlie knows no Inuktituk. According to his map, Charlie estimates it is one hundred miles to the closest town and decides to walk. He soon learns that he is not well equipped for outdoor life in the north, at least not as well equipped as Kanaalaq, who is in her element.

He is experimenting with smoking and openly preoccupied with the opposite sex, which makes him the brunt of jokes among his male classmates and constantly gets him into trouble with the school's strict headmaster, Father Fitzpatrick. As penance and to redirect his energies, Father Fitzpatrick orders Ralph to join the school's cross-country running team under the tutelage of the school's avant-garde-thinking teacher, Father Hibbert. Some of the more unusual circumstances of Ralph's life are that he lives by himself in the family home, telling the authorities that he is living with his paternal grandparents (who are in reality deceased), and telling his widowed, hospitalized mother (his father was killed in the war) that he is staying with a friend. Ralph's focus in life changes after his mother falls into a coma. It will take a miracle for her to come out of that coma. After two unrelated and somewhat innocent comments made to Ralph by Father Hibbert on prayer, purity, faith, and running the Boston Marathon, Ralph believes that that miracle will be him winning the 1954 Boston Marathon, for which he only has 180 days to train. To obtain the necessary physical and spiritual requirements to achieve this goal, Ralph receives some help from his friends Claire Collins and Chester Jones, and from Alice, one of the hospital's compassionate nurses. Although he believes Ralph's mission is misguided, Father Hibbert, who has his own secret past running history, becomes Ralph's personal trainer. These actions place Father Hibbert and Ralph at odds with Father Fitzpatrick, who sees his and other authority figures' roles as needing to show Ralph his place in life.","['Adam Butcher', 'Michael Kanevsky', 'Gordon Pinsent', 'Tamara Hope', 'Chris Anton']","['Dean Armstrong', 'Shannon Brand', 'Anthony Carovillano', 'Emmanuel Denizot', 'Jane Douglas']",['Michael McGowan'],['Canada'],['English'],"['Alliance Atlantis Communications', 'Amaze Film + Television', 'Running Miracles Productions']"

He is immediately attracted to her and her nose, which bears an uncanny resemblance to the nose of Elizabeth Montgomery, who played Samantha on Bewitched (1964). He becomes convinced she could play Samantha in his new series. Isabel is also taken with Jack, seeing him as the quintessential mortal man with whom she can settle down and lead the normal life she so desires. It turns out they're both right, but in ways neither of them ever imagined.","['Nicole Kidman', 'Will Ferrell', 'Shirley MacLaine', 'Michael Caine', 'Jason Schwartzman']","['Rachel Aberly', 'Warren Adams', 'Wendy Altman-Cohen', 'Jenifer Bonisteel', 'Danielle Clemenza']",['Nora Ephron'],['United States'],"['English', 'Spanish']","['Columbia Pictures', 'Red Wagon Entertainment', 'Bewitched']"
436724,"Reveals a groundbreaking dance phenomenon that's exploding on the streets of South Central, Los Angeles. Taking advantage of unprecedented access, this documentary film bring to first light a revolutionary form of artistic expression borne from oppression. The aggressive and visually stunning dance modernizes moves indigenous to African tribal rituals and features mind-blowing, athletic movement sped up to impossible speeds. We meet Tommy Johnson (Tommy the Clown), who first created the style as a response to the 1992 Rodney King riots and named it Clowning, as well as the kids who developed the movement into what they now call Krumping. The kids use dance as an alternative to gangs and hustling: they form their own troupe and paint their faces like warriors, meeting to outperform rival gangs of dancers or just to hone their skills. For the dancers, Krumping becomes a way of life--and, because it's authentic expression (in complete opposition to the bling-bling hip-hop culture), the dance becomes a vital part of who they are.","['Larry Berry', 'Tommy the Clown', 'Dragon', 'Jassy Marie', 'La Niña']","['Monique Barrett', 'Salar Bil', 'Luca Pizzaroni', 'Irwin M.

In story one, Mamie works as a psychologist at an abortion clinic, she, in addition to providing counseling, assessing mental fitness and thus approving or declining the request by potential patients for the procedure. This job is somewhat ironic as she purportedly aborted a pregnancy when she was seventeen, nineteen years ago. Her stepfather urged her to go through with the pregnancy and give the baby up for adoption, he, now dead, the only person in her personal life who knew that she went through with it. She is approached by Nicky, an aspiring filmmaker, who has proof of her son's identity, said son who threw such information away in no longer wanting to contact her. As his application for a scholarship to the AFI, Nicky wants to make a film on Mamie ""discovering"" her son. Not wanting to have her story splashed across a movie screen, especially as the biological father is still in her life and doesn't know, while wanting to know the identity of her son which Nicky won't divulge unless she agrees to the documentary, Mamie enlists the help of her masseuse boyfriend, Mexican immigrant Javier, to throw Nicky off the track of her plan of stealing the information from him while helping him with his AFI scholarship submission. Mamie, Nicky and Javier's lives may take a turn as documentaries often take on a life of their own. In story two, Charley, Mamie's stepbrother, who is the biological father of Mamie's child from a very brief sexual relationship they had after her mother and his father married, has grown up to realize his homosexual orientation. Managing the last existing of the chain restaurants he and Mamie inherited from their father, Charley is in a long term relationship with Gil, an architect. They are best friends with Gil's friend from high school, Pam, and her current partner, Diane. Pam and Diane had once asked Gil to be the sperm donor to artificially inseminate Pam, but ultimately they decided to use sperm from a bank instead that resulted in their now two year old son, Max. Sharing his belief with Gil but not the extent to which he is going, Charley is convinced that Pam and Diane did end up using Gil's sperm to father Max without telling them, he going on a quest to discover proof. And in story three, twenty-two year Otis has worked at Charley's restaurant for two years. He also plays in a band. Not the best drummer or backup vocalist, Otis' band-mates keep him in the band as his wealthy father, Frank, provides the band with many of their toys, he spreading his money easily to those in his life. Still in the closet in fearing Frank's disapproval, inexperienced Otis secretly has a crush on Charley. Needing a temporary vocalist, the band ends up hiring Jude, who Otis met performing karaoke at the restaurant. Opportunistic Jude knows the situation into which she is walking, she using Otis' naiveté to get to Frank and his money.","['Lisa Kudrow', 'Steve Coogan', 'Jesse Bradford', 'Bobby Cannavale', 'Maggie Gyllenhaal']","['Steve Altman', 'Wendy Altman-Cohen', 'David Arnott', 'Bree Bailey', 'Susan Bannout']",['Don Roos'],['United States'],"['English', 'Spanish']","['Lions Gate Films', 'Capital Arts Entertainment']"

Although she didn't see it as being perfect, she probably would have stuck it out as what she saw as the ""for better or worse"" obligation of the wedding vows, that is if her ex-husband, Kevin, didn't end it for what ended up being leaving her for a younger woman. She is urged by her over-supportive family, comprised of her many siblings, their partners, and her widowed father, to get back into the dating scene, something she has been reluctant to do in not feeling ready. As such, her most proactive sister in the matter, Carol (Elizabeth Perkins), sets her up on an Internet dating site. Within her less than prepared state, Sarah does go along with meeting men by the means offered to her. Beyond especially her female siblings, Sarah is given unique perspectives on the whole issue of dating and commitment by her father, Bill (Christopher Plummer), who is exploring dating after losing who was the love of his life in Sarah's mother, thrice divorced Dolly (Stockard Channing), one of Bill's conquests, who he meets on-line, and Sarah's gay teaching colleague, Leo (Brad William Henke), who she sees as being in the most committed loving relationship with his partner Eric (Victor Webster) of anyone she knows. Of the men she meets, Sarah makes what she believes is a connection with two, albeit awkward in both cases. One is Bob Connor (Dermot Mulroney), the divorced father of one of her students, her hesitance in dating him only because of crossing the professional/personal line. The other is custom wooden boat builder Jake Anderson (John Cusack), who too was pushed into trying on-line dating by his best friend/divorce lawyer Charlie (Ben Shenkman), who wants Jake solely to get some action despite Jake wanting his love life to be more like Lara and Yuri in Doctor Zhivago (1965). Much of what happens between Sarah and the two men is based on what stage they are in post-divorce dating life, but is also dependent on how much Sarah is willing to take a chance on each, which may also include her and the respective man just not meshing at a given point in time, and her making a wrong decision in the process based on what she sees as the prospects.","['Diane Lane', 'John Cusack', 'Elizabeth Perkins', 'Christopher Plummer', 'Dermot Mulroney']","['John Arbuckle', 'Joanna August', 'Michael Bilog', 'Marcin Borkowski', 'Ursula Brauner']",['Gary David Goldberg'],['United States'],"['English', 'Armenian']","['Warner Bros.', 'Team Todd', 'Ubu Productions']"

404030,"Jewish-American writer Jonathan Safran Foer is a collector of his family's memorabilia, although most of the items, some which he takes without asking, would not be considered keepsakes by the average person. He places most of those items in individual Ziploc bags, and hangs them on his keepsake wall under the photograph of the person to who it is most associated. He has this compulsion in an effort to remember. He is able to tie a photograph that he receives from his grandmother, Sabine Foer, on her deathbed - it of his grandfather, Safran Foer, during the war in the Ukraine, and a young woman he will learn is named Augustine - back to a pendant he stole from his grandfather on his deathbed in 1989, the pendant of a glass encased grasshopper. Learning that Augustine somehow saved his grandfather's life leads to Jonathan going on a quest to find out the story at its source where the photograph was taken, in a now non-existent and probably largely forgotten town called Trachimbrod that was razed by the Nazis during the war, he armed only with his limited knowledge, the pendant, his grandfather's Star of David necklace, the photograph, tip ""money"", and an old and largely outdated map. Prior to arriving in the Ukraine, Jonathan prearranges the guide services of Odessa-based Heritage Tours, which specializes in helping Jewish expats discover their past. The company is owned and operated by three generations of the Alexander Perchov family, who generally think Jewish people are stupid for wanting to revisit their past, and spend large sums of money for their services in doing so. The three from Heritage assigned to Jonathan's file are: the company founder Alexander I (""Grandpa""), the retired, non-blind blind man who will be the driver; his ""seeing eye"" dog, Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., a deranged bitch of a dog; and Alexander III (""Alex""), a western pop cultural loving young man, whose broken English will need to suffice for translation. Jonathan will learn that his guides are a loving but dysfunctional lot who have little interest in helping him beyond taking his money. But during their time together, this quest will affect Jonathan, Grandpa and Alex in different ways, all tied to the value of remembering.","['Eugene Hutz', 'Elijah Wood', 'Jonathan Safran Foer', 'Jana Hrabetova', 'Stephen Samudovsky']","['Judy Aley', 'David Allsberry', 'Lauren Barnhart', 'Oksana Batuik', 'Mandy Butler']",['Liev Schreiber'],['United States'],"['English', 'Russian', 'Ukrainian']","['Warner Independent Pictures', 'Telegraph Films', 'Big Beach Films', 'Stillking Films']"

After reading a newspaper article about the just occurred November 14, 1959 cold blooded murders of the Clutter family in their rural Kansas home, Truman feels compelled to write about that event as his next article. So he and his personal assistant Nelle Harper Lee, also a southern born New Yorker and an aspiring writer of her own, head to Kansas to research the story first-hand. Truman hopes to use his celebrity status to gain access to whomever he needs, such as to Laura Kinney, a friend of the Clutter daughter she who discovered the bodies, and to Alvin Dewey, the lead police investigator and also a Clutter family friend. If his celebrity doesn't work, Truman will grease the wheels by whatever means necessary. When the police eventually charge suspects, two young men named Dick Hickcock and Perry Smith, Truman uses those same tactics to gain access to them. Truman's fascination with the story makes him believe that he can revolutionize writing by expanding the germ of the article into what he calls a non-fiction novel.

402057,"The blood-soaked tale of a Norse warrior's battle against the great and murderous troll, Grendel. Heads will roll. Out of allegiance to the King Hrothgar, the much respected Lord of the Danes, Beowulf leads a troop of warriors across the sea to rid a village of the marauding monster. The monster, Grendel, is not a creature of mythic powers, but one of flesh and blood - immense flesh and raging blood, driven by a vengeance from being wronged, while Beowulf, a victorious soldier in his own right, has become increasingly troubled by the hero-myth rising up around his exploits. Beowulf's willingness to kill on behalf of Hrothgar wavers when it becomes clear that the King is more responsible for the troll's rampages than was first apparent. As a soldier, Beowulf is unaccustomed to hesitating. His relationship with the mesmerizing witch, Selma, creates deeper confusion. Swinging his sword at a great, stinking beast is no longer such a simple act. The story is set in barbarous Northern Daneland (Denmark).","['Hringur Ingvarsson', 'Spencer Wilding', 'Stellan Skarsgård', 'Ingvar Sigurdsson', 'Gunnar Eyjólfsson']","['Cynthia Amsden', 'Kim Ballard', 'Shirine Best', 'Mel Churcher', 'Friðrik Friðriksson']",['Sturla Gunnarsson'],"['Canada', 'United Kingdom', 'Iceland', 'United States', 'Australia']","['English', 'Latin', 'Icelandic']","['Movision', 'Endgame Entertainment', 'Beowulf Productions Limited', 'Grendel Productions Inc.', 'Icelandic Film', 'Spice Factory', 'The Film Works', 'Téléfilm Canada', 'Union Station Media']"

Working at the mine does not sit well with her father, Hank Aimes, who also works at the mine and who, like the other male workers, believes she is taking a job away from a man. Hank has believed that all Josey's problems are of her own doing, ever since she, unmarried, had Sammy while she was still in high school. Josey has always stated that she does not know who Sammy's biological father is, which fosters Hank's attitude about her. Among Josey's coworkers is Bobby Sharp, who many believe is Sammy's biological father. Josey's evangelical mother, Alice Aimes, stands by her husband in their general belief of traditional roles of men and women. Josey and her fellow female mine workers are continually harassed, emotionally, physically and sexually by their male counterparts. Every seeming step forward in the issue Josey finds is only a measure to lull the women into a false sense of security, or to make the fall even harder.

She does so with the help of Glory and her husband Kyle's friend, Bill White, an ex-New York lawyer who is facing his own emotional demons.

In 1972, she is an up-and-coming Los Angeles based journalist who has been given the lucrative assignment of convincing once successful comic Vince Collins, who is at the tail end of his career, to allow her to ghost write his memoirs. Most specifically, she has the task from her publishers of discovering the reason behind two issues in Vince's life from 1957: why he and his former on-stage partner Lanny Morris, who is still active and well known within the entertainment business, broke up their professional partnership shortly after they hosted a successful thirty-nine hour telethon for polio research in Miami, there not having been any indication of problems between the two before that; and how did the dead body of Maureen O'Flaherty end up in the water filled bathtub in Vince and Lanny's New Jersey hotel suite, the opening of that New Jersey hotel owned by mobster Sally Sanmarco which was Lanny and Vince's next gig after the telethon. Maureen, a college student, was working part-time as a room service waitress at the Miami Versailles Hotel where Vince and Lanny were staying during the telethon, she who had served the pair at the time. The last she was known to be seen was by the Miami hotel staff when Lanny and Vince were still staying there three days before the discovery of her body, with the official cause of death being accidental drowning as she had narcotics in her system. Neither Lanny or Vince was ever implicated in having anything to do with Maureen's death or even how she got from Miami to New Jersey coinciding with their own travels. Despite there perhaps being more well known writers who could do the job, the publishing company chose Karen as, known or unknown to Vince, she was the Miracle Child, a polio survivor who appeared on the 1957 telethon. During her research, Karen is unable to meet with Lanny, who, through his legal representatives, tells her that he is writing his own explosive tell-all book which will make her project meaningless. In Karen's search for the truth, things get complicated when she starts receiving from an anonymous source upcoming chapters from Lanny's memoirs which may purely be to throw her off the track from reality, and when she meets Lanny in the flesh, she not divulging to him who she really is.","['Kevin Bacon', 'Colin Firth', 'Alison Lohman', 'David Hayman', 'Rachel Blanchard']","['Jack Beardsley', 'David Bermingham', 'Esther Bradbury', 'Sherrie Bradshaw', 'James Burke']",['Atom Egoyan'],"['Canada', 'United Kingdom']","['English', 'Cantonese']","['Serendipity Point Films', 'First Choice Films', 'The Movie Network (TMN)', 'Téléfilm Canada', 'Movie Central Network', 'Ego Film Arts', 'The Harold Greenberg Fund']"

The move is in response to Connex losing a number of oil fields in the Persian Gulf region as Prince Nasir Al-Subaai, his country's foreign minister, and the oldest son of the Emir and thus the heir apparent to the throne, signed a contract with the Chinese instead. As Killen somehow managed to get the contract for the oil fields in Kazahkstan, the merger would give Connex-Killen additional control of the industry in the Middle East. Connex's retained law firm, headed by Dean Whiting, assigns Bennett Holiday to demonstrate to the US Department of Justice that due diligence has been done to allow the merger to proceed i.e. that the merger would not break any antitrust regulations. The US government is unhappy with Prince Nasir's decision to award the contract to the Chinese, and in combination with issues around illegal weapons, the CIA assigns field agent Bob Barnes, who has experience in the Middle East, to assassinate the Prince, whose eventual leadership would further undermine US oil security. Barnes becomes a pawn in the goings-on between the players. Meanwhile, Geneva based Bryan Woodman, an energy analyst, eventually becomes associated with the Emir and his family, largely due to a tragic incident. In the process, Woodman learns of Prince Nasir's western leanings and his want to change radically his country into a western democracy with a diversified economy. If the Emir found out, it could threaten Prince Nasir ascension to the throne and thus derail the democratization process. Through all these manoeuvrings, migrant workers are affected, some who cannot retain work with the changing of companies controlling the oil. Some of those may try to take matters into their own hands for their form of justice.","['Kayvan Novak', 'George Clooney', 'Amr Waked', 'Christopher Plummer', 'Jeffrey Wright']","['Abde Sallam Ait Abdellah', 'Kirby Adams', 'Samia Adnan', 'Nasser Ahmed', 'Talal Al Dhabyani']",['Stephen Gaghan'],"['United States', 'United Arab Emirates']","['English', 'Urdu', 'Arabic', 'Persian', 'French', 'Mandarin']","['Warner Bros.', 'Participant', '4M', 'Section Eight', 'FilmWorks', 'MID Foundation']"

349467,"Late one evening, Brenda Martin, a thirty-seven year old Caucasian woman from the proverbial wrong side of the tracks, enters Dempsy Medical Center in Dempsy, New Jersey with minor injuries, but she is also emotionally distraught. One of the people to who she tells her story is Dempsy Police Detective Lorenzo Council, a black man. That story is that she was just carjacked by another unknown black man when she took a shortcut that she had never traveled between the Armstrong housing projects, where she works at the Rainbow Club, a children's center, and her home in Gannon, New Jersey. Her emotional distress is because her four year old son, Cody, was asleep in the back seat of the car and is thus now in the hands of the carjacker. Brenda's brother, Danny Martin, a police detective in Gannon, cannot help but get directly involved in the investigation despite he operating outside his jurisdiction. His actions do not sit well with Council, who he insinuates is not only not doing his job, but is protecting his own ""people"", i.e. the primarily black populace in the Armstrong housing projects. In addition, the residents of the projects feel that Brenda is getting special treatment as a white woman, as several children have gone missing from the projects without such a frenzied police intervention, which is unnecessarily and unfairly disrupting their lives. Karen Collucci with Friends of Kent, a volunteer organization that conducts searches for missing children, also offers their services, which Council eventually accepts with the caveat that they work under his directive. ""Kent"" was Collucci's own son never found, his disappearance which destroyed her personal life. Through the process, Council can't help but think that Brenda isn't telling them the entire story...","['Samuel L.

It was clear to everyone that Daniel was not a typical artist - a disquieting innocence, with references to both light and dark spiritual forces, were evident throughout his work. It was this distinctive voice that compelled local musicians to share his art beyond Austin's city limits, culminating in respected indie musicians like Tom Waits, Beck, and Wilco to either record his songs or reach out to collaborate.

Preferring to test the odds alone, career gambler Dylan Johns ignores captain's orders to wait below for possible rescue and sets out to find his own way to safety.

In Morocco, a troubled married couple are on vacation trying to work out their differences. Meanwhile, a Moroccan herder buys a rifle for his sons so they can keep the jackals away from his herd. A girl in Japan dealing with rejection, her mother's death, her father's emotional distance, her own self-consciousness, and a disability, deals with modern life in the enormous metropolis of Tokyo, Japan. On the opposite side of the world the married couple's Mexican nanny takes the couple's two children with her to her son's wedding in Mexico, only to meet trouble on the return trip.

After being released from her latest stint behind bars, Jerri wants to clean up her life and decides the best way is to return to the home and family she left 32 years earlier to embark on her depraved life. When she gets there, her mother has died and her father has married a much-younger woman and fallen into a stress-induced coma in part because she disappeared. She takes the cleaning-up-her-life one step further when her father's doctor tells her that he might emerge from his coma if life could return to the way it was before she left, only better: she must make her father proud. So Jerri returns to Flatpoint High to get her high school diploma. She quickly decides the best way to be the best student possible is to participate in and win the state science fair. In her quest, she gets caught up in the competing agendas of: Principal Onyx Blackman, who needs a winning science fair team so as not to have to return discretionary school board funding, which he obtained through fraud and which he has since misappropriated; science teacher Chuck Noblet, a married born-again-Christian closet homosexual who tries quietly (or not so quietly) to win back the affections of his lover, Geoffrey Jellineck, the sensitive art teacher; and Roger Beekman, the winning teacher of the past nine science fairs whom Blackman brings into Flatpoint as a ringer, much to Noblet's chagrin. Jerri must also also keep her focus on the end goal of her father, which might not be easy for a socially-unaware middle-aged libidinous junkie prostitute who wants to be one of the popular kids, and do it with the big man and the innocent virginal girl on campus.","['Amy Sedaris', 'Paul Sedaris', 'Chandra Wilson', 'Kristy Thomas', 'Dee Finley']","['Ashley Bearden', 'John Bloom', 'Donna Cipriani', 'John Daro', 'Lindsay Feldman']",['Paul Dinello'],['United States'],['English'],"['Comedy Central Films', 'Roberts/David Films', 'Worldwide Pants']"

468489,"Young Caucasian Dan Dunne teaches history and coaches the girls basketball team at a Brooklyn high school populated primarily by black and Hispanic students. To the chagrin of his superiors, Dan bucks the outlined curriculum of historical facts in favor of the philosophy of historical events, generally discussing the concept of dialectics. As such, he captures the imagination of his students, at least in the classroom. Outside of the classroom, Dan's life is in shambles. He has a distant but cordial relationship with his family. He uses illicit drugs rampantly. Although his former girlfriend Rachel was able to clean up her drug habit, Dan believes that rehab will not work for him. Due to a combination of these issues, he treats women poorly. Thirteen-year-old Drey is a student in his class and a player on his basketball team. Drey has her own problems. Her parents are divorced, with her father a virtually non-existent figure in her life and her EMT mother generally absent as she is always working to provide for Drey. Her older brother Mike is incarcerated for selling drugs for a local dealer named Frank. Mike took the fall for Frank, who in turn protects Drey whether she wants to be associated with him or not. Dan and Drey's relationship changes when Drey catches Dan, believing he is alone, smoking crack in the girl's locker room bathroom. He is totally stoned. Their resulting friendship, which is seen as inappropriate by the few who know, is based on each being unable to deal with their own life, but feeling like they can be at least a minor salvation in the other's life.","['Ryan Gosling', 'Jeff Lima', 'Shareeka Epps', 'Nathan Corbett', 'Tyra Kwao-Vovo']","['Ronald Arceneaux', 'E.J.

354899,"Following the death of his father from cancer, Stéphane - Mexican on his father's side, French on his mother's side - agrees, despite his less than proficient use of the French language, on his mother's request to move back to France from Mexico, she not only letting him live in her apartment in his old bedroom in the building she owns while she stays with her current boyfriend Gérard, a magician, but she having found him a job using his graphic art skills at a calendar shop. The job ends up not being quite as she had made it out to be - it more a dead end menial job - but Stéphane is still able to eke out a friendship of sorts with his new coworkers, especially Guy, the senior employee, a bully of a man-child who obsesses about sex and who becomes Stéphane's confidante. Concurrently, Stéphane strikes a friendship with his neighbor, Stéphanie, and her friend, Zoé, Stéphane and their friendship stemming out of some mistruths, including the two artistically inclined women not divulging they, like him, lead dead end nine-to-five jobs, and Stéphane also not divulging that he is actually Stéphanie's neighbor and the son of her landlady which allows him to spy on Stéphanie's apartment without notice. While Stéphane is romantically interested in Zoé, he believes Stéphanie in turn is interested in him. Regardless, Stéphane forms a special bond with Stéphanie, their similar names only one of the many factors which may indicate that the cosmos meant for them to have this bond. Despite what Stéphanie may feel for Stéphane in return, their friendship/relationship will be affected by Stéphane often not being able to differentiate between reality and what are, to him, his very vivid dreams.","['Gael García Bernal', 'Charlotte Gainsbourg', 'Alain Chabat', 'Miou-Miou', 'Pierre Vaneck']","['Raffi Adlan', 'Stéphanie Bermann', 'Douglas Costa', 'Amélie Couvelaire', 'Tatum Drouilhat']",['Michel Gondry'],"['France', 'Italy']","['French', 'English', 'Spanish']","['Partizan Films', 'Gaumont', 'France 3 Cinéma', 'Canal+', 'TPS Star', 'Mikado Film', 'New Japan Pro-Wrestling Co']"

814075,"Former Catholic priest Oliver O'Grady - Father Ollie in more familiar circumstances - talks about his life as priest, including what he saw as his many failings in that role. Although not stating it as one of those failings, he also speaks about the sexual abuse of minors, both girls and boys, in his role as a priest, where his victims number in the hundreds covering approximately two decades in Central California, with his youngest known victim being nine months old. He admits that he spent as much time planning his abuses, which included gaining the confidences of parents sometimes also in sexual means, than he did with actual ministering. A handful of his victims and their support networks speak of how the abuse was able to happen, how it has negatively affected their collective lives to this day (while Father Ollie walks seemingly happy a free man in his native Ireland), and how they are trying to regain their faith in a holistic manner. Experts talk about how items specific to the Catholic religious structure institutionalize such abuse where power rests in the hands of a small few, while the flock - the masses - are meant, as good Catholics, to be subservient to that power, and why the abuse of girls is treated differently by the church than that of boys. This documentary then opens up the discussion to the fact that clergy abuse within the Catholic church is not isolated only to Father Ollie, but is widespread, may be institutionalized psychologically, and efforts are still made at almost every step by those in positions of power, including the Pope, to protect the abusers at the expense of the victims. In Father Ollie's case, he was moved from parish to parish within his diocese (the Los Angeles Diocese) and often promoted, while his victims were told he would be moved not only into therapy but into positions where children could no longer be abused.","['Adam', 'Jeff Anderson', 'Pope Benedict XVI', 'Monsignor Cain', 'Case Degroot']","['Jacquie Aquines', 'Josh Braun', 'Matthew Cooke', 'Nick McCarthy', 'Nicole Merineau']",['Amy Berg'],['United States'],['English'],['Disarming Films']

Britain is the one remaining civilized society on the planet, which has resulted in people wanting to migrate there, so it has become a police state to handle the immigrants, who are placed into refugee camps. Lowly government bureaucrat Theo Faron, once an activist, is approached by the Fishes, deemed a terrorist group, led by his ex-wife Julian Taylor, whom he hasn't seen in almost 20 years, since their marriage disintegrated after their infant son Dylan's death during the 2008 flu pandemic. Although the Fishes did use terrorist means in their on-going revolution against the state in the fight for immigrant rights, Julian vows that they now garner support solely by speaking to the people, and she wants Theo to use his connections to get transit papers for a young immigrant woman named Kee who needs to get to the coast. Although initially reluctant to do it because of the difficulty, Theo is able to grant Julian this favor, however with the change that he now needs to accompany Kee on her journey. As Theo and Kee progress on that journey, Theo learns more and more about what's going on, including the reason that Kee needs to get to the coast, the fact that no one in the group knows if their end destination even exists, and that his and Kee's lives are in greater danger than he believed when they started the journey. But Theo's sole mission becomes to help Kee at any cost for the survival of the species.","['Juan Gabriel Yacuzzi', 'Mishal Husain', 'Rob Curling', 'Jon Chevalier', 'Rita Davies']","['Sonia Ortiz Alcon', 'Harriette Allen', 'Vanessa Allen', 'Helen Appleby', 'Mark Barclay']",['Alfonso Cuarón'],"['United States', 'United Kingdom', 'Japan']","['English', 'German', 'Italian', 'Romanian', 'Spanish', 'Arabic', 'Georgian', 'Russian', 'Serbian']","['Universal Pictures', 'Strike Entertainment', 'Hit & Run Productions', 'Ingenious Film Partners 2', 'Toho-Towa']"

Idealistic Erin Gruwell is just starting her first teaching job, that as freshman and sophomore English teacher at Woodrow Wilson High School, which, two years earlier, implemented a voluntary integration program. For many of the existing teachers, the integration has ruined the school, whose previously stellar academic standing has been replaced with many students who will be lucky to graduate or even be literate. Despite choosing the school on purpose because of its integration program, Erin is unprepared for the nature of her classroom, whose students live by generations of strict moral codes of protecting their own at all cost. Many are in gangs and almost all know somebody that has been killed by gang violence. The Latinos hate the Cambodians who hate the blacks and so on. The only person the students hate more is Ms. Gruwell.

And it isn't until she provides an assignment of writing a daily journal - which will be not graded, and will remain unread by her unless they so choose - that the students begin to open up to her. As Erin tries harder and harder to have resources provided to teach properly (which often results in her needing to pay for them herself through working second and third jobs), she seems to face greater resistance, especially from her colleagues, such as Margaret Campbell, her section head, who lives by regulations and sees such resources as a waste, and Brian Gelford, who will protect his ""priviledged"" position of teaching the senior honors classes at all cost.

Daphne was mother of the bride for a first time at Maggie's wedding, and a second time at Mae's wedding, but she fears there won't be a third and final time for a Milly wedding in insecure Milly attracting only who seem to be the wrong men. Not wanting Milly to turn into another ""alone"" version of herself at age sixty, Daphne, without telling any of her daughters let alone Milly, decides to take matters into her own hands by placing a personal ad for a potential mate for Milly. Scheduling all seventeen interviews in succession at a restaurant, Daphne finds the ad has attracted one ""loser"" after another, until she reaches number seventeen, Jason, an architect who is handsome and seems smart, well-bred, successful and forward thinking about his life. The two arrange for Jason to meet Milly by ""accident"". What Daphne does not anticipate is that there ends up being a number eighteen, Johnny, who witnessed the interviews from the sidelines as the guitarist performing at the restaurant, and while Johnny did approach Daphne in his interest in meeting Milly from what he heard of the interviews, she immediately dismissed him solely because he is a musician and thus irresponsible by nature, much like her ex-husband. In their accidental meetings, Milly embarks on a relationship with both Jason and Johnny concurrently, and upon learning about Johnny in the picture, Daphne starts pushing Jason as the favored one to Milly. Beyond Milly, Jason and Johnny's own thoughts about their two relationships, the two men who know nothing about the other being in Milly's life, a question becomes how Milly eventually learning about the ad, an inevitability, will factor into what happens, not only about Milly's love life but her relationship with her mother. In helping Milly with her love life and only fostered by watching old Gary Cooper movies, Daphne may dredge up latent feelings of romance of her own, it which she may find in the most unlikely of places.","['Diane Keaton', 'Mandy Moore', 'Gabriel Macht', 'Tom Everett Scott', 'Lauren Graham']","['Mike Alexander', 'Lesa Andelson', 'Carrie Arnold', 'Aynsley Baldwin', 'Nancy Banks']",['Michael Lehmann'],['United States'],"['English', 'Mandarin', 'Italian']","['Universal Pictures', 'Gold Circle Films']"

2582802,"Nineteen-year-old Andrew Niemann wants to be the greatest jazz drummer in the world, in a league with Buddy Rich. This goal is despite not coming from a pedigree of greatest, musical or otherwise, with Jim, his high-school-teacher father, being a failed writer. Andrew is starting his first year at Shaffer Conservatory of Music, the best music school in the United States. At Shaffer, being the best means being accepted to study under Terence Fletcher and being asked to play in his studio band, which represents the school at jazz competitions. Based on their less than positive first meeting, Andrew is surprised that Fletcher asks him to join the band, albeit in the alternate drummer position which he is more than happy to do initially. Andrew quickly learns that Fletcher operates on fear and intimidation, never settling for what he considers less than the best each and every time. Being the best in Fletcher's mind does not only entail playing well, but knowing that you're playing well and if not what you're doing wrong. His modus operandi creates an atmosphere of fear and of every man or woman for him/herself within the band. Regardless, Andrew works hard to be the best. He has to figure out his life priorities and what he is willing to sacrifice to be the best. The other question becomes how much emotional abuse he will endure by Fletcher to reach that greatness, which he may believe he can only achieve with the avenues opened up by Fletcher.","['Miles Teller', 'J.K.

Dumont, on the suggestion of her immediate supervisor, the shop foreman Jean-Marc, figures that her section of the company can function with sixteen people working full time with a bit of overtime instead of seventeen with no overtime, that seventeenth person being Sandra. Because of the global competition the company faces, Dumont decides the company can only finance the annual bonuses for those sixteen employees, which are EUR1,000 per person, or Sandra's job, leaving the decision to those sixteen. On a Friday near the end of her medical leave, Sandra learns of this situation from her friend and co-worker Juliette after the ""show of hands"" vote is held, the result a 13-3 decision for the bonuses over Sandra's job. Because Juliette knows Jean-Marc, who is determined to get rid of Sandra, influenced the vote by scare mongering through misinformation, Juliette and Sandra, at the end of the working day on Friday, are able to convince Dumont to hold another secret ballot on Monday morning, with Sandra needing a majority to keep her job, meaning nine votes. By Saturday morning, Sandra's supportive husband, Manu, convinces her that over the weekend she should speak to each and all of the thirteen who voted for the bonuses to get them to change their minds. The Byas not only need the income from Sandra's job but Manu believes the job is a symbol for Sandra of her own self worth, important now in her tenuous mental state. As Sandra reluctantly goes about this task, she finds that not only is she uncomfortable being in this somewhat confrontational situation, but that the people who voted against her have their own household conflicts over their own EUR1,000, which would keep some of them afloat financially. As the weekend progresses, Sandra will find if she is strong enough emotionally to deal with the situation.","['Marion Cotillard', 'Fabrizio Rongione', 'Catherine Salée', 'Baptiste Sornin', 'Pili Groyne']","['Tania Antonioli', 'Julie Beaulieu', 'Naziha Chahed', 'Marie-Christine Damiens', 'Cédric Iland']",['Jean-Pierre Dardenne'],"['Belgium', 'France', 'Italy']","['French', 'Arabic', 'English']","['Les Films du Fleuve', 'Archipel 35', 'BIM Distribuzione', 'Eyeworks', 'France 2 Cinéma', 'Radio Télévision Belge Francophone (RTBF)', 'Belgacom', ""Centre du Cinéma et de l'Audiovisuel de la Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles"", 'VOO', 'Vlaams Audiovisueel Fonds', 'Eurimages', 'Canal+', 'Ciné+', 'France Télévisions', 'La Wallonie', 'Tax Shelter du Gouvernement Fédéral Belge', 'Casa Kafka Pictures', 'Casa Kafka Pictures Movie Tax Shelter Empowered by Belfius', 'Cinéfinance Tax Shelter', 'MEDIA Programme of the European Union', 'Diaphana Films']"

The climate change and a series of solar storms have turned in a desert the surface of the planet and annihilated to the 99.7 % of Earth's population, leaving alive 21 million people across the world in a single city covered by mechanical clouds (zeppelins anchored to the city) to make rain. Trying to rebuild the world again, a robot company named ROC Corporation create Automata Pilgrim 7000 with two security protocols: 1st, a robot cannot harm human beings, and 2nd, a robot cannot alter himself or another robot. But this situation changes when police officer Sean Wallace shoots and destroys a robot claiming that it was altering himself. With the company worried by the possible implications if the case were known by the people, insurance agent Jacq Vaucan is chosen to investigate the happened, while Vaucan tries to convince his boss, friend and brother-in-law Robert Bold to transfer him and his pregnant wife Rachel to the coast, with Bold accepting the request if Vaucan solves the case. Going with Wallace to a brothel, they meets a robot in blue wig named Cleo, who is shot by Wallace in the belief that Cleo will go with the mysterious repairman that Vaucan calls The Clocksmith. However, Cleo travels a mechanical workshop property of Dr. Susan Dupré, who informs Vaucan about a terrible possibility: that the robots can alter their second protocol themselves to acquire self awareness, implying a non-human intelligence that easily it should overpass the human brain after a test where she mixed a biocore from the Wallace's shot robot with Cleo's own biocore. Vaucan reports secretly Bold about it, but ROC's chairman intercepts the message. When Dr. Dupré is killed in front of Vaucan by a ROC's squad group, he and Cleo run from the assassins, ending outside the city, lost in the white desert that surrounds the city. Forced to meet ROC's chairman, this reports Bold about the secret of the two protocols: that the Pilgrim 7000's prototype was created without them, and due to its unlimited intelligence and learning, he overcame to its human owners just eight days later. After to escape, all the next Pilgrims were created with the protocols to limit their capacity in order to have them under control. Fearing the extinction of human race if all the Pilgrims evolve beyond the protocols, ROC's chairman blames Vaucan of Dupré's assassination and the alteration of the robots to cover up to the public, and Wallace is hired to find Cleo and Vucan and kill them. According Vaucan, Cleo and three robots more travel across the desert to the forbidden and radioactive zone to meet The Clocksmith, Vaucan will find himself as witness of something that it would change the world as nobody could imagine.","['Antonio Banderas', 'Dylan McDermott', 'Melanie Griffith', 'Birgitte Hjort Sørensen', 'Robert Forster']","['Ivaylo Asparuhov', 'Nencho Balabanov', 'Josef Brandmaier', 'Ivaylo Brusowski', 'Wes C.

She played Sigrid, an opportunistic eighteen year old in an emotionally dependent lesbian relationship with forty year old Helena, who was at a vulnerable stage of her life. Maria has turned down the play's upcoming London revival in which she would now play Helena, it remounted by director Klaus Diesterweg. Her reasons for turning down the role are many including: being at a vulnerable stage of her own life going through a painful divorce; remembering the suicide of Susan Rosenberg, the original Helena, following the original run of the play, the suicide purportedly mirroring what happens to Helena; and the painful memories of the production in still having hard feelings toward who was her older male costar, Henryk Wald, with who she had an affair at the time. Maria reconsiders and accepts the role when Wilhelm unexpectedly passes away, she hearing the news en route to the Zurich Film Festival where she was to accept an award on recluse Wilhelm's behalf. Maria begins to regret her decision, largely due to having to work with nineteen year old Jo-Ann Ellis as Sigrid, Jo-Ann a trained actress whose Hollywood lifestyle is making her self-destruct, this behavior which Maria, who hates the Internet and the Hollywood gossip on it, did not know before signing the contract. But what may be most difficult for Maria is the role opening up her own professional relationship and friendship with her younger American personal assistant, Valentine, the two who are staying at Wilhelm's mountain retreat in Sils Maria in the Swiss Alps, where Maria is preparing for the play and where many of the locations were inspiration for the play's themes.","['Juliette Binoche', 'Kristen Stewart', 'Chloë Grace Moretz', 'Lars Eidinger', 'Johnny Flynn']","['Anibal Mon Alvarez', 'Toma Baqueni', 'Charlotte Bayle', 'Jette Blümler', 'Gero Brugmann']",['Olivier Assayas'],"['France', 'Germany', 'Switzerland']","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Swiss German']","['CG Cinéma', 'Pallas Film', 'CAB Productions', 'Vortex Sutra', 'Arte France Cinéma', 'ZDF/Arte', 'Orange Studio', 'Radio Télévision Suisse (RTS)', 'SRG - SSR', 'Ezekiel Film Production', 'Eurimages', ""Centre national du cinéma et de l'image animée (CNC)"", 'ARTE', 'Ciné+', 'Canal+', 'Deutscher Filmförderfonds (DFFF)', 'Mitteldeutsche Medienförderung (MDM)', 'Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg', 'Filmförderungsanstalt (FFA)', 'Office Fédéral de la Culture', 'MEDIA Programme of the European Union', 'BLS Business Location Südtirol-Alto Adige', 'Cinéforom', 'Fondation Ernst Göhner', 'Loterie Suisse Romande', 'New Japan Pro-Wrestling Co', 'Stage Pool Focal', 'Succés Passage Antenne', 'Suisse Tourisme']"

Considered white trash by many, Die does whatever she needs, including strutting her body in front of male employers who will look, to make an honest living. That bread-winning ability is affected when she makes the decision to remove her only offspring, fifteen year old Steve Després, from her previously imposed institutionalization, one step below juvenile detention. She institutionalized him shortly following her husband's death due to Steve's attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and his violent outbursts. He was just kicked out of the latest in a long line of facilities for setting fire to the cafeteria, in turn injuring another boy. She made this decision to deinstitutionalize him as she didn't like the alternative, sending him into more restrictive juvenile detention from which he would probably never be rehabilitated. However, with this deinstitutionalization, she has to take care of him which means only being able to do home based work. Despite they always yelling expletives at each other and Steve sometimes demonstrating those violent tendencies toward her, Die and Steve truly do love each other, his emotions which are sometimes manifested as an Oedipus complex especially as he seems to need her complete attention most specifically when it is being directed at possible male suitors. Their lives, both individually and as a family, are affected with the entrance of two of their neighbors. The first is Paul, a lawyer, who does have that sexual interest in Die as he tries to help Steve through his legal problems. The second and more important is Kyla, who lives across the street with her husband Patrick and their adolescent daughter, they who are in transit in their life to wherever Patrick's job will take them. Kyla is a high school teacher on sabbatical as she deals with her own emotional issues, which are manifested in stuttering whenever she feels incapable of dealing with her life.

Among the dangerous people, Holmes cites the example of Sebastian Moran - a retired colonel and respected man, but in reality a dangerous criminal. Holmes and Watson decide to track down the colonel, for which they visit the Bagatel club, in which Moran was a regular. At the club, Holmes receives a note requesting a meeting. The detective leaves, and Watson remains to observe Moran. Holmes is brought to Milverton's mansion. In the office of the murdered man he is met by a tall, hunched man. This is Professor Moriarty - Napoleon of the underworld, head of a powerful criminal organization known throughout Europe; it was just Milverton and Moran. Moriarty guessed that Holmes was present in the house of the blackmailer during the murder, and the encryption was not taken by Scotland Yard, but Holmes, thereby disrupting the organization's plans. Taking the moment, Holmes stuns the professor, picks up the taken revolver and leaves, saying that Moriarty has no evidence for him. While Holmes was talking with a professor, Watson witnessed an unpleasant scene at the Bagatelle club.

In Switzerland, Holmes discovers that Moriarty's gang has been captured, but with the exception of the leader himself. He and Watson go to visit one of the wonderful local attractions - Reichenbach Falls. The detective notes that this is a ""well-chosen place"" and feels doomed, while Dr. Watson, full of positive emotions, does not understand the complexity of the situation. A boy messenger runs to the waterfall and gives Watson a note asking the English doctor to examine the patient with consumption. The doctor is forced to retire. Holmes is left alone. He knew that Moriarty would crave revenge and simply killing Holmes was not enough for him. He came to Switzerland for Holmes and predicted the place of the match at the waterfall. When meeting with Professor Holmes asks him a few minutes to write the last letter, and he allows him. The detective leaves a note in a cigarette case near his outer clothing. A deadly duel began. Professor Moriarty perfectly mastered the baritsu fight and hoped to defeat Holmes soon, but he also had a good command of this fight. Returning to the hotel, Watson realized that the note was a distraction. Taking a revolver with him, he rushed back to the waterfall, and behind him - Peter with a gun. Meanwhile, the fight continued. Moriarty pulled Holmes to the edge of the cliff to die with him. When the outcome of the fight was close, Holmes discovered the shooter who appeared at the scene - Colonel Moran: he appeared when Watson left. Of the last forces clinging to Holmes, Moriarty slides off a cliff and dies in a waterfall, while Holmes remains hanging on the edge of the cliff in his arms.

Michael Burry, an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and, as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry's beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum, an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the financial industry. Baum and his associates, who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley, decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burry's information, they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies, with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley, who are minor players in a $30 million start-up garage company called Brownfield, get a hold of Vennett's prospectus on the matter. Wanting in on the action but not having the official clout to play, they decide to call an old ""friend"", retired investment banker Ben Rickert, to help out. All three of these groups work on the premise that the banks are stupid and don't know what's going on, while for them to win, the general economy has to lose, which means the suffering of the general investor who trusts the financial institutions. That latter aspect may not sit well with Baum. Some of these assumptions may be incorrect and may be far more manipulative than they could have ever imagined, which in turn may throw curves into the process.","['Ryan Gosling', 'Rudy Eisenzopf', 'Casey Groves', 'Charlie Talbert', 'Harold Gervais']","['Alex Aaron', 'Kd Amond', 'Rachel Andrew', 'Colleen Cavanaugh Anthony', 'Chandler Barbee']",['Adam McKay'],['United States'],['English'],"['Paramount Pictures', 'New Regency Productions', 'Plan B Entertainment']"

Her only experience of being in such an environment is going through hostile zone training a few years earlier. Immediately upon her arrival in Afghanistan, she realizes that she is ill-prepared emotionally for this assignment, not only enduring the dangers of the war itself, but also the conditions of everyday life, including largely been seen by men as only a ""piece of ass"" and a distraction despite her being considered average looking back home and not being overtly sexual, and being an individual with a small bladder who is nonetheless told to stay hydrated at all times.

She also has to figure out how much of what she does truly is her, and how much is being as she and the other western press corps members state is being in the ""Kabubble"". What may also affect her life is how much the war in Afghanistan is overtaken by other world events for which the American public is wanting information, and thus if Afghanistan has a specific time span in her life regardless of how much she may want to stay to tell what she sees as its important stories.","['Tina Fey', 'Margot Robbie', 'Martin Freeman', 'Alfred Molina', 'Christopher Abbott']","['Julie Adams', 'Mark Alkofer', 'Sitara Attaie', 'Sahar Bibiyan', 'Lance Blea']",['Glenn Ficarra'],['United States'],"['English', 'Pashto', 'Dari', 'French']","['Broadway Video', 'Little Stranger', 'Paramount Pictures']"

He lives an extremely regimented and routinized life, that routine perhaps most vividly displayed by the fact that he is able to wake up at exactly the same time every day without an alarm. That life includes eating Cheerios for breakfast, walking to work carrying his brown bag lunch packed in his lunch pail by his wife Laura, having a casual chat with his colleague Donny before he begins his shift driving the #23 Paterson bus for the local public transit company, walking home where he straightens out the exterior mailbox which somehow during the day gets knocked crooked, eating dinner with Laura and listening to her goings-on of the day, taking Laura's English bulldog Marvin - who he would admit to himself he doesn't much like - out for a walk to his neighborhood bar where he has one and only one beer before walking home with Marvin. There are day to day variations which are often the result of how certain other routines associated to him manifest themselves, such as what drama will occur in the relationship of Marie and Everett who are always at the bar together despite her always saying that they are no longer together, or in what form Laura's unique and distinctive design sense will affect Paterson's life directly or indirectly. Paterson's keen observances of what happens around him are largely the bases for the poems he writes, he constantly thinking of these and writing them in his secret notebook whenever he has a spare moment during his day. He is influenced by among others Paterson natives such as William Carlos Williams and his epic poem ""Paterson"". Paterson's writing are largely for himself, although Laura would like him to share more with her and the rest of the world. Something that happens to Paterson this week has the potential to knock his routinized world into a tailspin.","['Adam Driver', 'Golshifteh Farahani', 'Nellie', 'Rizwan Manji', 'Dominic Liriano']","['Laila Archuleta', 'Randall Balsmeyer', 'William Berloni', 'Steve Berman', 'Shannon Blaney-Bezanyuk']",['Jim Jarmusch'],"['France', 'Germany', 'United States']","['English', 'Italian']","['K5 International', 'Amazon Studios', 'Inkjet Productions', 'Le Pacte', 'Animal Kingdom']"

The explosion, although botched, was set up by a select group of the French Interior Ministry as a decoy so they can make a half billion dollar digital transfer from a bank (closed on French National Day) -- hence the title Bastille Day. In a separate CIA investigation the unruly agent Sean Briar discovers the real story behind Mason's ""terrorist attack"". The two men, on different sides of the law, collaborate to bring the corrupt members of the Ministry down.","['Idris Elba', 'Richard Madden', 'Charlotte Le Bon', 'Kelly Reilly', 'José Garcia']","['Rodrigue Adompo', 'Segolene Amice Lagny', 'Sashi Arnold', 'Anthony Bas', 'Laurent Blu']",['James Watkins'],"['United Kingdom', 'France', 'United States', 'Belgium', 'Luxembourg', 'China', 'Germany']","['English', 'French']","['StudioCanal', 'Anton', 'Amazon Prime Video', 'Vendome Pictures', 'TF1 Films Production', 'Canal+', 'Ciné+', 'TF1', 'Anonymous Content', 'MEDIA Programme of the European Union', 'China Film Group Corporation', 'The Take', 'Aerial Camera Systems']"

In this paradise, Red (Jason Sudeikis, We're the Millers, Horrible Bosses), a bird with a temper problem, speedy Chuck (Josh Gad in his first animated role since Frozen), and the volatile Bomb (Danny McBride, This is the End, Eastbound and Down) have always been outsiders.

5278506,"David Farrier, a New Zealand pop cultural reporter whose story subjects often verge into the bizarre, believes he's found his next story when he stumbles across an online video on the world of competitive endurance tickling, a sport where the participants, with hands and feet tied down, are tickled for as long as they can endure. Participants are flown to Los Angeles first class, paid $1,500, and put up for four nights in a luxury hotel. Suitable participants are deemed to be younger, muscular males. The event is held on a monthly basis. In contacting the organizers, US-based Jane O'Brien Media, via their popular Facebook page to arrange for an interview, David receives a return message from one of their representatives, Debbie J. Kuhn, declining the offer, the message a homophobic rant largely against David. In that message, Debbie asserts that the competition is wholly a heterosexual athletic activity, she who does not appreciate what will be David's assumed gay bent on the story as a homosexual himself (which David does not state he is or isn't in his request). David finds the message all the more odd as the activity as it appears in the videos has an undeniable gay vibe. What is even more odd is that Debbie on behalf of Jane O'Brien, continually emails David over the following weeks expounding on the themes in the original message. At this time, David's friend, Dylan Reeve, enters the fray, acting initially as a researcher for David, and then eventually as co-filmmaker for a documentary on the subject. However, the documentary eventually morphs from the sport of competitive endurance tickling into the mysterious world of Jane O'Brien and Debbie Kuhn, especially: as they seem to have unlimited resources both to hold the events and to conduct their online harassment they learn not only of David, but of former associates who now seem to want to distance themselves from the ""sport"" and Jane O'Brien Media; as Jane and Debbie initiate legal action and threaten even more legal action, and issue general threats time and time against David and Dylan not only for this unauthorized documentary but for their activities toward Jane O'Brien Media as a whole; and as no one seems to know who Debbie or Jane are, even the people that work for them, or what their end goal is, namely what will be done with the resulting videos of the competitions, which populate the Internet. The story takes a further twist when David and Dylan learn there truly is a tickling sexual fetish subculture, one within that community, Richard Ivey, who willingly talks to David and who remembers someone else online decades ago within the community with a similar M.O. to Debbie and Jane.","['David Farrier', 'Dylan Reeve', 'David Starr', 'Kevin Clarke', 'Adam']",['Kiara Walker'],['David Farrier'],['New Zealand'],['English'],"['A Ticklish Tale', 'Fumes Production', 'Horseshoe Films']"

3553976,"Ben and Leslie Cash live largely off the grid with their offspring -- Bodevan, Kielyr, Vespyr, Rellian, Zaja and Nai -- in a cabin in the mountains of Washington state. The parents have passed their socialist and survivalist ideals to their children. Ben considers most of Western society to be fascist, especially corporate America. He also believes that no one will or should be there for you, so you'd better learn how to take care of yourself. As such, the children have been subject to vigorous physical training; know how to deal with minor bumps, bruises, cuts, sprains, and even fractures; and know how to hunt, forage, and grow their own food. The children are also non-registered home schooled, meaning that they have no official academic records. Ben and Leslie have tried to make the children critical thinkers, however, within the context of their ideals. Beyond these issues, Ben and Leslie made the decision to live this lifestyle for Leslie's health. Formerly an attorney, Leslie was diagnosed as bipolar. Ben believes that this disorder started with her postpartum depression with Bo. Yet Leslie's condition has worsened. Despite not believing in Western medicine, Ben sends Leslie to a hospital close to Ben's sister, Harper, so that there can be family close by. While hospitalized, Leslie commits suicide. Beyond the collective grief, Leslie's act brings out a battle between Ben and Leslie's father, Jack Bertrang, a Christian who not only blames Ben for Leslie's death, but believes that what he is doing ""to"" the children can legally be considered abuse. Jack takes over the funeral arrangements as per his and his complacent wife Abby's Christian morals, against what Ben knows was Leslie's wishes, as she believed in Buddhist philosophies. Although Jack threatens to call the police if Ben shows up to the funeral, Ben and the children believe it is their mission to honor Leslie's last wishes to be cremated as per Buddhist philosophy. This mission not only may bring the divide between Jack and Ben to a head, but may also bring out some long dormant issues between the Cash children as they are exposed to commercial America in all its good and bad, and as Bo grows into manhood, he may have his own ideas of what he should do with the next phase of his life.","['Viggo Mortensen', 'George MacKay', 'Samantha Isler', 'Annalise Basso', 'Nicholas Hamilton']","['Rio Allen', 'Lars Berg Andersen', 'Hannah Aronoff', 'Jason Aumann', 'Maggie Ballard']",['Matt Ross'],['United States'],"['English', 'Esperanto', 'German', 'Chinese']","['Electric City Entertainment', 'ShivHans Pictures']"

5278596,"Serving seven consecutive terms, Anthony Weiner, good friends with and political allies to the Clintons, was once a highly respected member of Congress from New York City, he seen as a man sticking up for the every day person. That all changed in June, 2011 when he was forced to resign in disgrace after admitting that he did tweet lewd ""headless"" photos of himself from his public Twitter account to women he met online, and that it was not the work of a hacker or that the photos were of someone else. At the time, his wife Huma Abedin, herself a key aide to Hillary Clinton, was pregnant with their first child, she who decided to stand by her man. Two years later with Abedin still by his side, Weiner tries to resurrect his political career in a run for New York City mayor. He realizes that he has an uphill battle not only because of the known previously tweeted photos, but that there are other lewd photos from that era that may also come to light during the campaign. Regardless of the 2011 resignation, Weiner may not want to admit that any wrongdoing in his personal life should affect his ability to do his job as a politician, congressman, mayor or otherwise. He is probably well aware that the behavior associated with the tweeted photos will dog him during the entire election campaign - with some voters not caring what he does in his personal life, some never willing to forgive or forget such behavior, and some in the middle, those who he has to convince to vote for him. But will the collective ""they"" - including his campaign staff and Abedin - care and forgive a second time around if the behavior has continued, especially if he did or does not own up to it?","['Anthony Weiner', 'Huma Abedin', 'Jordan Zain Weiner', 'Barbara Morgan', 'George McDonald']","['Lisa Callif', 'Samantha Casey', 'Marisa Kapust', 'Andrew Morreale', 'Susan Ricketts']",['Josh Kriegman'],['United States'],['English'],"['Edgeline Films', 'Motto Pictures']"

5275892,"It is the defining cultural tale of modern America - a saga of race, celebrity, media, violence, and the criminal justice system. And two decades after its unforgettable climax, it continues to fascinate, polarize, and even, yes, develop new chapters. Now, the producers of ESPN's award-winning ""30 for 30"" have made it the subject of their first documentary-event and most ambitious project yet. From Peabody and Emmy-award winning director Ezra Edelman, it's ""O.J.: Made in America,"" a 10-hour multi-part production coming summer of 2016. To most observers, it's a story that began the night Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were brutally murdered outside her Brentwood apartment. But as ""O.J."" lays bare, to truly grasp the significance of what happened not just that night, but the epic chronicle to follow, one has to travel back to a much different, much earlier origin point, at not the end, but the beginning of the 20th century, when African-Americans began migrating to California en masse, in desperate, collective hope of a better life, trying desperately - and fruitlessly - to outrun the racism that had defined their lives. And among the thousands who came west from the south were the grandparents of Orenthal James Simpson. The tale is familiar from there. In the mid-1960's, Simpson rose to instant fame as an unstoppable running back for the USC Trojans, and later, not just a record-setting Hall of Famer in the NFL, but a crossover, charismatic superstar with a singular foothold in the celebrity landscape. In retirement, O.J. remained as popular as any active athlete - a broadcaster, pitch-man, and actor. But he stood alone for another reason as well. Living in the shadows of everything from the Civil Rights Movement to the Rodney King riots and so much in between, in a country forever divided by racial lines and a city with a horrific legacy of institutionalized police racism, O.J. Simpson managed always to find a way to transcend the color of his skin. That is, until everything changed on that June night of 1994. ""O.J."" revisits - and redefines - it all. The domestic abuse. The police investigation. The white Bronco chase. The trial of the century. The motive, the blood, the glove. The verdict. The aftermath. Drawing upon more than seventy interviews- from longtime friends and colleagues of Simpson to the recognizable protagonists of the murder investigation to observers and commentators with distinct connections to the story - the docu-event is an engrossing, compelling, and unforgettable look at a tantalizing saga. Because at the end of what seems like a search for the real truth about O.J. Simpson, what's revealed just as powerfully is a collection of indelible, unshakeable, and haunting truths about America, and about ourselves.","['Kareem Abdul-Jabbar', 'Mike Albanese', 'Muhammad Ali', 'Marcus Allen', 'Bea Arthur']","['Yousur Alhou', 'Sangeda Alin', 'Louise Argianas', 'Miguel Batista', 'Miguel A.

When a child, Chiron lives with his single, crack addict mother Paula in a crime ridden neighborhood in Miami. Chiron is a shy, withdrawn child largely due to his small size and being neglected by his mother, who is more concerned about getting her fixes and satisfying her carnal needs than taking care of him. Because of these issues, Chiron is bullied, the slurs hurled at him which he doesn't understand beyond knowing that they are meant to be hurtful.

4276820,"1954. Having worked as a salesman most of his adult life, Ray Kroc has been a hustler in most senses of the word. That hustling has made him the target of derision among certain circles for peddling what have ended up being more novelty or faddish than useful products, but it has also placed more than a comfortable roof in Arlington Heights, Illinois over his and his wife Ethel's heads. Ethel, however, wishes that he placed as much effort into being at home with her as he does in selling; his current job of peddling five-spindle milkshake makers for Prince Castle which has him constantly on the road going from one drive-in restaurant to another. It is because of the beefs he has with the whole drive-in experience (bad food, bad service) in constantly eating at such establishments while on the road that he becomes enthralled with the concept of McDonald's Restaurant in San Bernardino, California, owned and operated by brothers Richard McDonald and Maurice McDonald - Dick and Mac. Unlike most of Ray's customers who will only require one five-spindle milkshake maker at any given time, the McDonald brothers end up purchasing eight machines for their single restaurant. Primarily on Dick's initiative, the brothers have redesigned the whole concept of the drive-in restaurant to focus on quality food through a smaller menu of only the most popular items (hamburgers, fries, sodas), consistency in product so that customers know what to expect from time to time, change in the target market from lounging teenagers to families, and perhaps most importantly speed in having any order ready within seconds, many of these goals achievable through assembly line styled production. They had tried franchising previously, but failed in that they lost control over many of those aspects which made their San Bernardino restaurant successful. Despite believing Ray a bit off kilter (in other words, crazy), the McDonald brothers somewhat hesitantly enter into a contract with him to be their head of franchising. Ray's experience in the job is not without its problems, especially as his franchisees seem to be making more money than he is, he who is only breaking even. He is not averse to advancing ideas provided to him to get ahead - original ideas which are not his forte - he seeing the brothers as his biggest problem in they thinking small. These differences lead to a standoff between Ray and the brothers, the former who has a different goal for ""his"" business in profit and stoking his own ego seemingly his main priorities.","['Michael Keaton', 'Nick Offerman', 'John Carroll Lynch', 'Linda Cardellini', 'B.J.

The summer in this collective is presented, when Moonee and her friends, such as Scooty, are out of school and are left largely to their own devices while self-absorbed Halley does whatever she wants, often just staying in the room watching TV. Halley is supposed to look after Scooty, the son of Halley's friend Ashley, they who live in the unit immediately underneath Halley and Moonee's, while Ashley is at work at a local diner. In turn, Ashley pilfers cooked meals from the diner to feed Halley, Moonee and Scooty. Over the course of the summer, Halley systematically begins to alienate one by one the people who are her unofficial support by responding with that disrespect to anything she feels is against her. As such, Halley begins to take more and more extreme measures to maintain the life she leads with Moonee.","['Brooklynn Prince', 'Christopher Rivera', 'Aiden Malik', 'Josie Olivo', 'Valeria Cotto']","['Nina Nahal Ameri', 'Björn Arnesen', 'Olivier Arnesen', 'Annie Avlon', 'Lorette Bayle']",['Sean Baker'],['United States'],"['English', 'Spanish', 'Portuguese']","['Cre Film', 'Freestyle Picture Company', 'June Pictures', 'Sweet Tomato Films']"

Despite ultimately garnering some success in figure skating being national champion, a world championship medalist, an Olympian, and the first American woman to complete a Triple Axel in competition, she is arguably best known for her association to ""the incident"": the January 6, 1994 leg-bashing attack on her competitor, Nancy Kerrigan--who, unlike Tonya, was everything that the figure-skating community wanted in their representatives. Her association to that incident led to Tonya being banned from competitive figure skating for life. Tonya's story from the beginning of her figure-skating life at age four to the aftermath of the incident is presented. Besides Tonya herself, key people in her life give their perspective of their role in her life. Although they may agree on the broad issues at hand, such as that the incident did occur, they may vary widely in their recollection of the details. These people are: her waitress mother Lavona Golden, who despite having paid for her expensive figure-skating lessons, was abusive toward her physically and emotionally, never believing she was good enough in any aspect of the word, and who pulled her from school to focus solely on the figure skating; Diane Rawlinson, her first and longest-serving coach, who, for good or bad, largely let Tonya be Tonya in the way she presented herself to the figure skating world; Jeff Gillooly, her first husband, and partner in a turbulent relationship on a need to be loved, perhaps without truly loving each other; Jeff's friend and Tonya's bodyguard Shawn Eckardt, a dim bulb who believed himself to be a bigger player in the big scheme of life than he actually was; and sports journalist Martin Maddox, a fictional character who provides general commentary of what the sports media as a collective wanted out of Tonya and the incident.","['Margot Robbie', 'Sebastian Stan', 'Allison Janney', 'Julianne Nicholson', 'Paul Walter Hauser']","['Kyle Allgood', 'Wendy Altman-Cohen', 'Bryce Anderson', 'Natalia Anderson', 'Jax Baker']",['Craig Gillespie'],"['United States', 'United Kingdom']",['English'],"['AI-Film', 'Clubhouse Pictures', 'Georgia Film, Music & Digital Entertainment Office', 'LuckyChap Entertainment', 'beIN Media Group']"

Given that the 27-year-old stand-up comic achieved fame as a teenager himself through YouTube by riffing on his insecurities, he is uniquely capable as the film's writer and director to tell the story of Kayla, an anxious girl navigating the final days of her eighth grade year, despite creating a protagonist female instead of male. Like Burnham did more than a decade ago, 13-year-old Kayla turns to YouTube to express herself, where she makes advice blogs in which she pretends to have it all together. In reality, Kayla is sullen and silent around her single father and her peers at school, carrying out most of her interactions with her classmates on Instagram and Twitter. Her YouTube videos are a clever narrative tool that provide insight into her inner hopes and dreams, much like an inspirational online diary.

Through interviews of his family and colleagues, the life of this would-be pastor is explored as a man who found a more important calling to provide an oasis for children in a video sea of violent bombardment.

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl's generous holiday spirit. Funny, heartwarming, and visually stunning, it's a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism. Academy Award nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company. With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Whoville when he runs out of food. Each year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter, and louder celebrations. When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas. To do so, he decides to pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh. Meanwhile, down in Whoville, Cindy-Lou Who (Cameron Seely), a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer, plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.

Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos' holiday cheer once and for all?","['Benedict Cumberbatch', 'Cameron Seely', 'Rashida Jones', 'Pharrell Williams', ""Tristan O'Hare""]","['Olivier Auba', 'David Bae', 'Lawrence Bendelac', 'Maki Berger', 'Sylvain Blanchard']",['Yarrow Cheney'],"['France', 'United States']",['English'],"['Universal Pictures', 'Universal Animation Studios', 'Illumination Entertainment', 'Dr. Seuss Enterprises']"

4595882,"In the early 1990s, Lee Israel, a biographer with a modicum of writing success, has fallen on hard times largely of her own doing. Her choice of subjects is in general not of interest to today's book buying public, and she, in her only true friends being her aged cat Jersey and a scotch and soda in not really liking people and people in turn not really liking her, has burned bridges with everyone her agent Marjorie has built for her. She will have to start from the ground up again if she wants a writing career, as, hiding behind her subjects, the book buying public will not buy a ""Lee Israel"" on the strength of her name in not knowing who she is as a writer or person. This situation has led to her being months behind in rent as she spends whatever little money she has on alcohol and Jersey's medical needs. In doing research for her latest book on Fanny Brice - with no advance from Marjorie - and selling a cherished personal memento of a handwritten letter from Katharine Hepburn in needing the money, Lee discovers there is a market for such celebrity memorabilia, and in the process decides, with her writing talent, to go into the fraudulent business of creating and selling fake personal documents purportedly by dead celebrities, especially of writers with strong public personas, such as Dorothy Parker and Noël Coward. She ends up befriending a gay past acquaintance from her literary circles, Jack Hock, also having fallen on hard times, Jack, not only becoming her drinking buddy, but her partner in crime. As they are able to get out of their financial holes in this business, Lee may begin to have second thoughts in also befriending Anna, one of the rare bookstore owners who likes Lee for Lee, an unusual position for her. But as the fraud looks like it may catch up specifically to Lee, she, feeling like these fakes are at least stretching her writing muscles, only becomes more resolute in at least the creative pursuit of what she's doing.","['Melissa McCarthy', 'Richard E.

Due to the intense enemy fire, the planes are shot down and most soldiers die in the landing or are killed by the Nazis' night patrols after they land.

4669788,"Docudrama focusing on two periods of the young adult life of future US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The first time period is the late 1950s in her stint as a student at Harvard Law School, her class only the sixth after women were admitted to the school and including only nine females. Dean Erwin Griswold makes known in veiled terms to those nine that he would prefer if it was still an all male institution. As such, Ruth knows that she has to work twice as hard as any male student to make herself known, which is made all the more difficult with unexpected issues at home with her fellow Harvard Law School student husband, Martin D. Ginsburg. The second time period is in the early 1970s. Despite wanting to get a job as a trial lawyer at a law firm, no such firm would hire her solely because she is a woman, and despite she finishing at the top of her class. Instead, she is teaching law at Rutgers specializing in sex discrimination in the law, this chosen specialization arguably as she has faced inherent sex discrimination in her chosen career and that she wants to inspire future generations of women to achieve what she has been unable to do herself because of that discrimination. Things change when Marty, now an esteemed tax lawyer, brings to her a case that he feels could change the face of her work, a tax case in which, solely because of the law, there is reverse discrimination, namely against a male, the two who decide to work on the case together, he from the tax side, she from the sex discrimination side. She is eventually able to convince her old friend Mel Wulf at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to provide the organization's official support. Ruth and Marty are told in no uncertain terms that in the strong possibility that they lose, the result could irrevocably set their careers back. Winning is made all the more difficult in they having to work within the structure that supports that sex discrimination as ""that's the way it's always been done"", and as Ruth has no trial experience, she who can come across as a bitter woman who the world has wronged.","['Felicity Jones', 'Armie Hammer', 'Justin Theroux', 'Sam Waterston', 'Kathy Bates']","['Aaron Becker', 'Gabriel Brakin', 'Reinier Brands', 'Dalia Bridi', 'Andrew Brooks']",['Mimi Leder'],"['United States', 'China', 'Canada']",['English'],"['Alibaba Pictures Group', 'Dreamworks Pictures', 'Participant', 'Québec Production Services Tax Credit', 'Robert Cort Productions']"
